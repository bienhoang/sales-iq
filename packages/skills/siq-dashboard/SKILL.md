# Workspace Dashboard

Open a local web dashboard for browsing and editing workspace files generated by sales-iq skills.

## When to Use

- User asks to "open dashboard", "view workspace", "browse outputs", or "edit files in browser"
- User wants a visual overview of their workspace content
- User wants to edit markdown files with a rich text editor

## Instructions

1. **Find the project root** by walking up from the current directory to find `.sales-iq.json`. If not found, tell the user to run `sales-iq init` first.

2. **Launch the dashboard server** in the background:

   First check if the local binary is available:
   ```bash
   which siq-dashboard
   ```

   If found, run:
   ```bash
   siq-dashboard --dir <project-root> &
   ```

   If not found, run:
   ```bash
   npx @bienhoang/sales-iq-dashboard --dir <project-root> &
   ```

3. **Wait ~2 seconds** for the server to start, then report the URL to the user (default: `http://localhost:4983`).

4. Tell the user:
   - The dashboard is running at the displayed URL
   - They can browse and edit workspace files in the browser
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the server

## Options

- `--port <number>` — Use a custom port (default: 4983)
- `--no-open` — Don't auto-open the browser

## Important

- Do NOT attempt to modify workspace files directly when the dashboard is running — direct the user to the dashboard UI instead.
- The dashboard only serves on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) — it is not accessible from other machines.
