# Post-Demo Follow-Up Templates

**When to use**: Within 24 hours of any product demo.
**Goal**: Confirm the technical win, maintain momentum, arm the champion, lock in next steps.

---

## Template 1 — Standard Post-Demo (within 2-4 hours)

**Subject**: `Notes + next steps from today's {{COMPANY_NAME}} demo`
*Alt subjects*:
- `What we covered today — and what's next`
- `{{FIRST_NAME}} — recap from this afternoon`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for the time today — I thought it was a productive session.

Quick recap of what we covered and what we heard from your team:

**What resonated**:
• {{PAIN_1}}: You confirmed that {{SPECIFIC_DETAIL_FROM_DEMO}} — this maps directly
  to the {{FEATURE}} we showed, which {{OUTCOME_1}}.
• {{PAIN_2}}: {{SPECIFIC_OBSERVATION_FROM_MEETING}}
• {{PAIN_3}}: {{SPECIFIC_OBSERVATION_FROM_MEETING}}

**Open questions from the call**:
• {{QUESTION_1}} — I'll follow up on this separately / answer below
• {{QUESTION_2}} — {{ANSWER_OR_NEXT_STEP}}

**What {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} achieved with a similar setup**:
{{ONE_SENTENCE_RESULT}} — happy to share the full case study if useful.

**Agreed next steps**:
1. {{NEXT_STEP_1}} — {{OWNER}}, by {{DATE}}
2. {{NEXT_STEP_2}} — {{OWNER}}, by {{DATE}}
3. {{NEXT_STEP_3}} — {{OWNER}}, by {{DATE}}

I'll send a calendar invite for {{NEXT_MEETING_TYPE}} on {{PROPOSED_DATE}}.

If anything has changed or there are questions from your team after reviewing,
I'm reachable at {{PHONE}} or just reply here.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing note**: Send within 2-4 hours while the demo is fresh. Same day is non-negotiable.
**Success metric**: Champion replies confirming next steps; or forwards the email internally.

## Template 2 — Demo with Technical Questions Outstanding

**Subject**: `Answers to {{FIRST_NAME}}'s technical questions + next steps`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Great session today. A few technical questions came up that I want to make
sure we answer properly before your team moves forward.

**{{TECHNICAL_QUESTION_1}}**
{{DETAILED_ANSWER}} — I've also attached our {{RELEVANT_DOC}} for more detail.

**{{TECHNICAL_QUESTION_2}}**
{{DETAILED_ANSWER}}

**{{TECHNICAL_QUESTION_3}}**
{{DETAILED_ANSWER}} — if you'd like to go deeper on this one, I can schedule
30 minutes with our {{SE_NAME / SOLUTIONS_TEAM}} specifically on {{TOPIC}}.

Everything else we discussed tracks well with {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s setup.

Next step on our end: {{SE_NAME}} will send the integration specification
doc by {{DATE}}. On your side, {{ACTION_FROM_PROSPECT}} by {{DATE}}.

Sound good?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

## Template 3 — Demo with Multiple Stakeholders (Champion-arming version)

**Subject**: `Summary for your team — {{COMPANY_NAME}} × {{YOUR_COMPANY}}`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for bringing {{STAKEHOLDER_LIST}} into today's session — it was
great to get the full team's perspective.

I've put together a brief summary you can share internally:

---
**What {{YOUR_COMPANY}} solves for {{COMPANY_NAME}}**

Problem: {{PAIN_SUMMARY_1_SENTENCE}}
Solution: {{SOLUTION_SUMMARY_1_SENTENCE}}
Proof: {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} saw {{RESULT_METRIC}} in {{TIMEFRAME}}.

**What we heard from your team today**:
• {{PERSON_1}} flagged {{CONCERN}} — addressed via {{SOLUTION}}
• {{PERSON_2}} confirmed {{PAIN_ACKNOWLEDGMENT}}
• Integration with {{THEIR_TOOL}} is confirmed supported natively

**Recommended next step**: {{NEXT_STEP}}
**Timeline**: {{PROPOSED_TIMELINE}}
---

Happy for you to forward this as-is or adapt it for internal use.

The one thing I'd ask: can we schedule {{NEXT_MEETING}} with
{{EB_NAME}} included? I think getting {{EB_TITLE}}'s perspective at
this stage will save time later.

{{SPECIFIC_DAY_OPTIONS}} work on my end.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Usage note**: This version gives the champion a ready-made internal email. Make it easy for them to advocate.

## Template 4 — Demo with Competitive Evaluation Confirmed

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — one thing worth considering as you evaluate`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Good meeting today. Since you mentioned you're also looking at {{COMPETITOR}},
I want to share one specific thing worth testing in their demo.

When you see them demo {{CAPABILITY}}, ask how they handle {{SPECIFIC_EDGE_CASE}}.
It's where we see the biggest difference in practice — and it's not obvious
until you're in implementation.

Not saying that to disparage them — just want to make sure you're comparing
on the criteria that will matter 6 months after go-live.

I'll send the full summary of today's session separately. For now:
our next step is {{NEXT_STEP}} — are you still good for {{DATE}}?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

---

## Template 5 — Demo Where Energy Was Low (deal-risk signal)

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — honest question after today`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I want to be direct with you: I sensed today's session didn't land the way
I'd hoped. I'd rather address that than pretend everything's on track.

A few possibilities:
a) We focused on the wrong things — if so, tell me what would have been
   more relevant and I'll rebuild the demo around that
b) The timing genuinely isn't right — if so, when would be?
c) There's a concern you didn't raise on the call — if so, I'd rather
   hear it now than after you've made a decision

No hard sell here. I just think {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s situation is genuinely
a strong fit for what we do, and I don't want a bad session to get in the way
of a good decision.

What's the honest read?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Usage note**: Use this when the demo felt flat, questions were few, or stakeholders were disengaged. Honesty at this stage saves weeks of false pipeline.
