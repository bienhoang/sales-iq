# Post-Proposal Follow-Up Templates

**When to use**: After a proposal has been delivered. Sequence runs over 3-4 weeks.
**Goal**: Advance to negotiation. Surface objections early. Keep champion armed. Prevent deal from stalling.

**Critical rule**: Always walk through the proposal live before sending. If it was emailed without a live review, use Template 1A to schedule the review call immediately.

---

## Template 1A — Proposal Sent Without Live Review (schedule the call)

**Subject**: `Quick 30 min to walk through the proposal — this week?`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I just sent over the proposal — before you dig in, I'd love 30 minutes
to walk through it together.

Proposals are easier to react to live than in email, and I want to make
sure the ROI model reflects your actual numbers rather than our assumptions.

Does {{DAY_1}} or {{DAY_2}} work this week?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Send 30 minutes after emailing the proposal.

---

## Template 1B — Proposal Delivered Live (immediate follow-up)

**Subject**: `Proposal recap + next steps — {{COMPANY_NAME}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `The numbers from today's review`
- `{{FIRST_NAME}} — summary from this afternoon`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for the time today. Here's a quick summary of what we covered:

**The proposal in brief**:
• Problem: {{PAIN_SUMMARY}} — estimated ${{TOTAL_PAIN_VALUE}}/year impact
• Solution: {{PRODUCT_NAME}} {{TIER}} — {{SEAT_COUNT}} seats
• Investment: ${{ACV}}/year | Payback: {{PAYBACK_MONTHS}} months | ROI: {{ROI_PCT}}%
• Start date: {{PROPOSED_START}}

**What you asked about / what I'm following up on**:
• {{QUESTION_1}} → {{ANSWER_OR_ETA}}
• {{QUESTION_2}} → {{ANSWER_OR_ETA}}

**Agreed next steps**:
1. {{YOUR_NEXT_STEP}} — by {{DATE}}
2. {{THEIR_NEXT_STEP}} — by {{DATE}}
3. Legal/security review kickoff — contact {{SECURITY_EMAIL}}

The proposal is valid through {{EXPIRY_DATE}}. Happy to discuss terms
before then — just let me know.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Send within 2 hours of the proposal review call.
**Success metric**: Champion replies confirming next steps or forwards proposal internally.

---

## Template 2 — Day 3 Follow-Up (no reply yet)

**Subject**: `One thing I forgot to mention, {{FIRST_NAME}}`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Following up on the proposal from {{DATE}}.

One thing I didn't cover in our call that I think is worth flagging:
{{RELEVANT_NEW_INSIGHT}} — e.g., "Teams who deploy before Q4 typically
see full ROI by the end of the fiscal year, which makes the case for
budget approval cleaner."

Also happy to build out a one-pager version of the ROI model if that
would be easier to share internally with {{EB_NAME}} — just say the word.

Any questions on what you've reviewed so far?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Day 3 after proposal delivery if no reply.
**Rule**: Add genuinely new value — do not just "bump" the previous email.

---

## Template 3 — Day 7 — Champion-Arming Email

**Subject**: `For your internal conversation, {{FIRST_NAME}}`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

As you discuss internally, a few things that tend to come up in conversations
like this — and how I'd suggest framing them:

**If the question is "why now?"**
The cost of staying with the status quo is ${{MONTHLY_PAIN_COST}}/month.
Every month of delay is ${{MONTHLY_PAIN_COST}} left on the table. That's the
urgency frame — not our quarter-end deadline.

**If the question is "why not just use what we have?"**
{{CURRENT_TOOL_OR_APPROACH}} solves {{WHAT_IT_SOLVES}}. It doesn't solve
{{THE_GAP_WE_FILL}}. That's the gap, specifically.

**If the question is "what's the risk?"**
We offer a {{PILOT_OR_PHASED_OPTION}} option for exactly this concern.
{{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} started with a 5-rep pilot and expanded within 60 days.

Happy to join any internal meeting where it would help to have me in the room.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Day 7 after proposal delivery.
**Usage**: Forward-ready — champion can use this directly in internal conversations.

---

## Template 4 — Day 14 — Urgency + Deadline

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — wanted to flag something on timing`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I want to be transparent about something on the timeline.

Our {{IMPLEMENTATION_TEAM / ONBOARDING_SLOTS}} for {{TARGET_QUARTER}} are
filling up — we typically book 4-6 weeks out. If {{COMPANY_NAME}} wants a
{{TARGET_START_DATE}} go-live, we'd need to finalize by {{DECISION_DATE}}
to hold your slot.

I'm not trying to manufacture pressure — I just want to make sure timing
doesn't become a problem after you've made the decision.

Where does the internal conversation stand? Is there anything on the proposal
I can clarify or adjust to move things forward?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Day 14. Use only if there is a legitimate capacity constraint — never fabricate urgency.

---

## Template 5 — Day 21 — Proposal Going Cold

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — still worth pursuing?`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I've sent a few notes since we reviewed the proposal and haven't heard back.
I don't want to keep following up if the timing or fit isn't right.

Quick question: is this still something {{COMPANY_NAME}} is actively considering,
or has something changed internally?

Either answer is genuinely helpful — I'd rather know than keep guessing.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Day 21 if no meaningful engagement.
**Purpose**: Force a clear signal — yes/no/not now. Silence is not a pipeline stage.

---

## Template 6 — Pricing Objection Received (negotiation opener)

**Subject**: `Re: Pricing — let's talk`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for the honest feedback on pricing — I'd rather work through this
than have it be a silent deal-killer.

A few questions to help me understand what we're working with:
• Is the concern the total ACV, the per-seat rate, or the payment structure?
• Is there a number that works, or is it a budget availability question?
• Is there a concession on your side (term length, timing, case study) that
  would give me flexibility to bring back a revised number?

I want to find a structure that works for both of us. But I need to understand
the specific constraint before I go back to my team.

Can we get 20 minutes on the calendar this week?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Usage**: Responds to a written objection on pricing. Never discount in email — take it to a call.

## Mutual Close Plan Template

Send this alongside Template 1B to create shared accountability:

```
MUTUAL CLOSE PLAN — {{COMPANY_NAME}} × {{YOUR_COMPANY}}

Goal: Signed agreement + kick-off scheduled by {{CLOSE_DATE}}

| Milestone | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|
| Proposal reviewed | Both | {{DATE}} | Complete |
| Internal review / stakeholder alignment | {{CONTACT_NAME}} | {{DATE}} | |
| Legal / security review initiated | {{THEIR_LEGAL}} + {{YOUR_SECURITY}} | {{DATE}} | |
| Commercial terms finalized | Both | {{DATE}} | |
| Contract sent | {{YOUR_COMPANY}} | {{DATE}} | |
| Contract signed | {{CLIENT_COMPANY}} | {{DATE}} | |
| Kick-off call | Both | {{DATE}} | |
| Go-live | Both | {{TARGET_GO_LIVE}} | |

Questions or blockers: flag to {{AE_NAME}} at {{AE_EMAIL}}
```

**Why this works**: A mutual close plan shifts the deal from "vendor selling" to "both teams executing a plan together." It surfaces blockers early and creates natural follow-up hooks at each milestone.
