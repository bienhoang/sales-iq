# Re-Engagement Templates

**When to use**: Deal has gone dark — no response in 14+ days. Or a previously lost/parked deal worth reviving.
**Goal**: Restart conversation without desperation. Lead with new value, not guilt.

---

## When to Re-Engage vs. When to Walk Away

**Re-engage if**:
- Deal went dark after strong engagement (they were interested; timing was the issue)
- A relevant trigger event has occurred (their funding, leadership change, competitor news)
- It's been 30-90 days and circumstances may have changed
- The ACV justifies the effort (typically >$20K)

**Walk away if**:
- Prospect explicitly said no or asked to not be contacted
- Deal was disqualified for a hard blocker (compliance gap, no budget path)
- Multiple re-engagement attempts have failed over 6+ months with no signal

## Template 1 — Day 1 Re-Engagement (trigger-based)

**Best use**: A specific trigger event gives you a genuine, non-pushy reason to reach back out.

**Subject**: `Congrats on the {{TRIGGER_EVENT}}, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `Saw {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s {{NEWS}} — thought of our conversation`
- `{{FIRST_NAME}} — relevant update since we last spoke`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Saw {{TRIGGER_EVENT}} — e.g., "{{COMPANY_NAME}}'s Series B announcement" /
"your new VP Sales hire" / "the product launch last week". Congrats — that's
a significant milestone.

It reminded me of our conversation back in {{MONTH}}. At the time, the timing
wasn't quite right. I'm curious whether {{PAIN_TOPIC}} looks any different
now that you're in {{NEW_CONTEXT}} — e.g., "scaling the team" / "a new
growth phase" / "a new leadership structure".

Worth a 20-minute conversation to see if the timing makes more sense now?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Send within 48h of the trigger event for maximum relevance.
**Success metric**: Reply engaging with the trigger event or reopening the conversation.

---

## Template 2 — Day 7 Re-Engagement (new angle / capability)

**Best use**: You have something genuinely new to share — a new feature, a relevant case study, or updated data.

**Subject**: `Something new that might change your thinking, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `New data on {{PAIN_TOPIC}} — relevant to {{COMPANY_NAME}}`
- `We just shipped something relevant to our last conversation`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Since we last spoke in {{MONTH}}, two things have changed that I think
are relevant to {{COMPANY_NAME}}:

1. **{{NEW_CAPABILITY_OR_FEATURE}}** — e.g., "We've launched native
   {{INTEGRATION}} integration, which was one of the gaps you flagged."

2. **{{RELEVANT_CASE_STUDY}}** — e.g., "{{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} — similar
   size, same industry — deployed in 21 days and recovered {{RESULT_METRIC}}
   in the first quarter. Happy to share the details."

I know timing was the main issue before. I'm not sure if that's changed —
but if it has, I wanted to make sure you had the latest picture.

Worth 20 minutes?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing**: Day 7 of re-engagement sequence.

---

## Template 3 — Day 21 — Challenger Re-Engage

**Best use**: Prospect went quiet after strong engagement. Use a thought-provoking insight to re-open.

**Subject**: `A question about {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s Q{{QUARTER}} forecast`
*Alt subjects*:
- `{{FIRST_NAME}} — the data on this surprised me`
- `What I'm seeing in {{INDUSTRY}} right now`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I've been thinking about our last conversation and wanted to share
something that might be relevant.

We analyzed pipeline data across {{NUMBER}} {{INDUSTRY}} companies at
{{COMPANY_NAME}}'s stage. The finding that surprised us most:

Teams that implemented pipeline intelligence tools in the first half of
the year outperformed their annual targets by an average of {{PCT}}%.
Teams that waited until H2 caught up operationally but missed the
compounding benefit of better early-stage qualification.

I don't know where {{COMPANY_NAME}} is tracking vs. your {{YEAR}} plan —
but if you're behind, this is worth a 20-minute conversation.

If you're ahead, I'd love to know what you're doing right.

{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. If this just isn't a priority — or I'm misreading the situation —
a one-line reply either way would be genuinely helpful.
```

**Timing**: Day 21. Leads with an insight, not an ask. P.S. line invites a "no" — often generates a reply.

---

## Template 4 — Lost Deal Re-Engage (90-day)

**Best use**: Deal was lost to a competitor or shelved. Reaching back after 90 days.

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — checking in 90 days later`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

It's been about three months since we last spoke. You went with {{COMPETITOR
/ decided to hold off}} — I respected that, and I hope it's going well.

I'm reaching out for a specific reason: a handful of customers who chose
{{COMPETITOR}} have come back to us in the past quarter. The common theme
has been {{SPECIFIC_GAP}} — not to trash them, just sharing what I'm hearing.

If {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s situation with {{PAIN_TOPIC}} has evolved, I'd genuinely
love to have a fresh conversation. No pitch — just an honest comparison of
where things stand now.

Worth 20 minutes?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Usage note**: Only use competitor-loss re-engage if you have credible intel on their gap. Never fabricate.

---

## Template 5 — Executive Escalation Re-Engage

**Best use**: Champion has gone dark but deal was strong. Try reaching above or around them.

**Subject**: `{{FIRST_NAME}} — wanted to reach out directly`

**Body** (to the economic buyer, not the champion):
```
{{EB_FIRST_NAME}},

I hope this isn't out of place — {{CHAMPION_NAME}} and I had a few
productive conversations about {{PAIN_TOPIC}} back in {{MONTH}}, and
I wanted to follow up directly with you.

I know priorities shift, and I may have caught your team at a busy time.
But the problem we discussed — {{PAIN_SUMMARY}} — doesn't go away, and
I think {{COMPANY_NAME}} is leaving real value on the table.

I'd welcome 20 minutes to share what {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} — a comparable
team — achieved in the 90 days after addressing this. No pitch — just
the data, and an honest assessment of whether it's relevant.

Would {{DATE}} work?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{TITLE}} | {{COMPANY}}
{{PHONE}}
```

**Usage note**: Use carefully. Always loop champion back in after — this is a tactical escalation, not a bypass. Inform the champion you're reaching out to the EB.

---

## Template 6 — Break-Up (end of re-engagement sequence)

**Subject**: `Closing the loop, {{FIRST_NAME}}`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I've reached out a few times over the past {{WEEKS}} weeks and haven't
heard back. I'm going to take that as a signal that the timing isn't
right, and I'll stop reaching out.

If anything changes — new initiative, different quarter, different
situation — I'm easy to find. You can always reach me at {{EMAIL}}.

Wishing {{COMPANY_NAME}} a strong {{QUARTER/YEAR}} regardless.

{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. If there's a reason this hasn't been the right fit that I should
know for future conversations, I'd genuinely appreciate a one-line reply.
It helps me improve.
```

**Timing**: End of re-engagement sequence (typically day 30-45).
**Why the P.S.**: Generates replies ~20% of the time. Those replies are worth reading — they reveal objections you didn't know existed.

| 3 | 21 | Challenger insight | Email | Thought-provoking data point |
| 4 (optional) | 30 | Executive escalation | Email | If champion gone dark |

## Re-Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Expected Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Re-open rate (any reply) | 10-20% |
| Meetings rebooked from re-engage | 5-10% |
| Average touches before re-open | 2-3 |
| Best performing template type | Trigger-based (Template 1) |

If re-engagement rate falls below 5%, review: is the list too cold? Is the pain still relevant? Are you reaching the right person?
