# Pricing Tiers — Generic B2B SaaS

## Pricing Philosophy

We sell value, not seats. Anchor conversations on ROI before introducing price. A prospect who understands they're losing $50K/month to inefficiency won't flinch at a $3K/month solution.

**Pricing model**: Per-seat SaaS with usage-based components at Enterprise tier.
**Billing**: Monthly or annual (annual = 2 months free / ~17% discount).
**Primary metric**: Active users (seats).

## ROI Anchors by Pain

Use these to justify price before presenting it:

| Pain | Typical Impact | Our Fix | Annual Value |
|------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| Reps spending 6+ hrs/week on manual CRM updates | 1 FTE = ~$80K fully loaded | Auto-logging saves 5 hrs/week | $10K–$20K per rep/year |
| Forecast inaccuracy causing missed targets | 10% miss = ~$500K revenue gap for $5M ARR co. | AI pipeline scoring to ±5% accuracy | $50K–$200K |
| Late-stage deal slippage (no early warning) | 1 lost deal = $30K–$100K ACV | Deal health alerts 3–4 weeks early | 1-2 deals saved/quarter |
| Ramp time for new reps (avg 6 months) | 3-month productivity loss = $40K/rep | Guided playbooks cut ramp to 4 months | $80K per 4 new hires |

## Negotiation Guardrails

**Never do**:
- Discount without getting a concession (longer term, more seats, case study, referral)
- Offer Enterprise features at Pro pricing — erodes tier integrity
- Reveal floor pricing in email — always discuss live

**Always do**:
- Confirm annual vs. monthly before quoting (anchor to annual)
- Build ROI case before presenting price
- Use tiered pricing to create an anchor (present Enterprise first, then Pro as the "sensible choice")
