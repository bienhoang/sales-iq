# Qualification Criteria — BANT + MEDDIC

## When to Use

Run this scorecard after your first discovery call. A deal scoring below 6/12 on MEDDIC should be reviewed with your manager before investing significant resources.

---

## BANT — Initial Triage (Gate 1)

Use BANT for early-stage triage before committing to a full MEDDIC evaluation. If any BANT criterion is hard-NO, qualify out or park the deal.

| Criterion | Question to Ask | Green | Yellow | Red |
|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Budget** | "Do you have budget allocated for this initiative?" | Budget confirmed & sized | Budget exists but not yet allocated | No budget; "maybe next year" |
| **Authority** | "Who else is involved in decisions like this?" | Economic buyer identified & engaged | Know who it is; not yet engaged | Unknown; contact won't say |
| **Need** | "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?" | Clear, quantified pain with urgency | Pain acknowledged, urgency unclear | Nice-to-have; no burning pain |
| **Timeline** | "When are you looking to have a solution in place?" | < 6 months with trigger event | 6-12 months | > 12 months or indefinite |

**BANT gate**: Proceed to full MEDDIC evaluation only if ≥ 3 of 4 are Green or Yellow.

## MEDDIC — Full Qualification Scoring (Gate 2)

Score each criterion 0, 1, or 2. Total out of 12.

### M — Metrics (0-2)

**Question**: "What does success look like in measurable terms 90 days after go-live?"

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | Specific, quantified success metrics agreed upon (e.g., "reduce time-to-close by 15%", "save 8 hrs/week per rep") |
| **1** | Metrics discussed but vague (e.g., "improve efficiency", "better reporting") |
| **0** | No metrics defined; prospect cannot articulate ROI |

**Notes**: _______________

### E — Economic Buyer (0-2)

**Question**: "Who ultimately signs the contract and releases the budget?"

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | Economic buyer identified by name/title, met with them, they are engaged and supportive |
| **1** | Identified but not yet met; or met once but no ongoing engagement |
| **0** | Unknown; champion won't introduce us; or EB is skeptical/hostile |

**Notes**: _______________

### D — Decision Criteria (0-2)

**Question**: "Walk me through how you'll evaluate vendors. What matters most?"

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | Full decision criteria documented; we influence the criteria (our differentiators are weighted heavily) |
| **1** | Criteria partially known; we have some but not all criteria |
| **0** | Unknown criteria; RFP-style black box; we cannot influence |

**Notes**: _______________

---

### D — Decision Process (0-2)

**Question**: "What does your internal process look like from vendor selection to signature?"

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | Full process mapped: who approves, legal/security timeline, procurement steps, signature authority |
| **1** | Process partially known; some steps unclear |
| **0** | No insight into process; prospect is vague or evasive |

**Notes**: _______________

### I — Identify Pain (0-2)

**Question**: "What's the cost of NOT solving this — in dollars, time, or risk?"

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | 3+ pains documented, quantified in business terms, acknowledged by economic buyer |
| **1** | Pains identified and articulated but not quantified or not EB-acknowledged |
| **0** | No clear pain; "we're just exploring"; evaluating for future use |

**Notes**: _______________

---

### C — Champion (0-2)

**Question** (internal): Does our contact have influence, access to power, and will they sell for us internally?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **2** | Champion confirmed: has internal credibility, access to EB, actively advocating, shared internal org chart or meeting notes with us |
| **1** | Potential champion; engaged and positive but not yet proven influence |
| **0** | No champion; our only contact is a gatekeeper or end user with no authority |

**Notes**: _______________

## Interpretation

| Score | Deal Health | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| **10-12** | Strong — commit to forecast | Full resources; accelerate to close |
| **7-9** | Qualified — upside deal | Continue advancing; address gaps |
| **4-6** | At risk — needs review | Manager review; assign action plan for each gap |
| **0-3** | Unqualified | Park or disqualify; do not commit resources |

---

## Disqualification Triggers

Immediately disqualify (or escalate to manager) if ANY of these are true:

- No budget and no path to budget in 2 quarters
- Economic buyer refuses all access and champion cannot change this
- RFP already written around a competitor's feature set
- Evaluation is purely for competitive pricing leverage
- Legal/security requirements we cannot meet (SOC 2, data residency, etc.)
- Champion departs and no backup contact exists

---

> **Note**: Scores are a guide, not a rule. A deal with a score of 6 and a strong champion in a must-win account may deserve more resources than a 9-scored deal in a low-priority segment. Use judgment — discuss with your manager.
