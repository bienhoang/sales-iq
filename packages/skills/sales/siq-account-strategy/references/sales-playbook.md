# Sales Playbook — Generic B2B SaaS

## Sales Methodology Overview

We use a **consultative, value-based selling approach** grounded in the Challenger Sale and MEDDIC qualification. Reps lead with insight, not product features. We sell business outcomes, not software.

**Core principle**: The rep who controls the conversation controls the deal. Control through questions, not pitches.

## Deal Stages

### Stage 1 — Discovery (0-20% probability)
**Goal**: Confirm there is a real problem worth solving and a willingness to change.

**Entry criteria**: Contact made, initial interest expressed.

**Exit criteria** (must achieve ALL):
- [ ] 3+ pain points documented and quantified
- [ ] Champion identified and engaged
- [ ] Basic BANT confirmed (budget exists, authority known)
- [ ] Next meeting scheduled with agenda agreed

**Rep activities**:
- Run a structured discovery call using SPIN questioning (see `siq-demo-prep`)
- Complete the qualification scorecard (see `siq-lead-qualification`)
- Research account via LinkedIn, Crunchbase, G2, and news

**Common mistakes**:
- Pitching before understanding pain
- Not identifying the economic buyer early
- Leaving without a committed next step

---

### Stage 2 — Qualification (20-40% probability)
**Goal**: Confirm fit and access to the economic buyer.

**Entry criteria**: Stage 1 exit criteria met.

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] MEDDIC score ≥ 8/12
- [ ] Economic buyer identified and meeting scheduled
- [ ] Decision criteria documented
- [ ] Rough timeline and budget range confirmed
- [ ] Multi-threaded (2+ contacts engaged)

**Rep activities**:
- Expand stakeholder map in account plan
- Run MEDDIC assessment with SE/manager
- Schedule executive briefing or business case call

**Qualification red flags** (consider disqualifying):
- No defined budget or "next year maybe"
- No internal champion willing to advocate
- Decision maker unresponsive after 3 touches
- Evaluation timeline > 9 months with no urgency trigger

---

### Stage 3 — Demo / Technical Validation (40-60% probability)
**Goal**: Prove the product solves the documented pains. Technical team validates fit.

**Entry criteria**: Stage 2 exit criteria met.

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] Technical win confirmed (SE sign-off)
- [ ] Top 3 pains addressed in demo, prospect acknowledged
- [ ] Integration requirements scoped
- [ ] Security/compliance review passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Verbal buy-in from champion and ≥1 technical evaluator

**Rep activities**:
- Use `siq-demo-prep` to build tailored demo script
- Prepare discovery questions mapped to account pains
- Run a post-demo debrief within 24 hours

---

### Stage 4 — Proposal (60-75% probability)
**Goal**: Present a compelling business case and commercial proposal.

**Entry criteria**: Technical win confirmed, economic buyer engaged.

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] Proposal delivered and walked through live (not just emailed)
- [ ] Pricing discussed without immediate rejection
- [ ] Verbal agreement on solution scope
- [ ] Procurement/legal process understood

**Rep activities**:
- Use `siq-proposal-generator` to build executive-ready proposal
- Include ROI model anchored to pains from Stage 1
- Schedule proposal review call — never send-and-pray

---

### Stage 5 — Negotiation (75-90% probability)
**Goal**: Reach mutually agreeable commercial terms without excessive discounting.

**Entry criteria**: Proposal accepted in principle, negotiating details.

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] Legal/security review initiated
- [ ] Final pricing agreed in principle
- [ ] Contract sent

**Negotiation rules**:
- Never discount without getting something in return (longer term, expand scope, case study rights, referral)
- Anchor high — start with list price, justify value before discounting
- Use `siq-objection-handling` for pricing objections
- Know your floor: minimum ACV, minimum term, approved discounts
- Create urgency with legitimate levers: quarter-end, seat lock-in, implementation slots

---

### Stage 6 — Close (90-100% probability)
**Goal**: Contract signed, payment terms set, handoff to CS initiated.

**Entry criteria**: Contract in final review.

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] Contract fully executed
- [ ] Payment terms set
- [ ] Implementation kickoff scheduled
- [ ] CS handoff completed with context doc

**Rep activities**:
- Send a "mutual close plan" to the champion — keeps both sides accountable
- Use `siq-follow-up` for final-stage nudge sequences
- Introduce CS lead before close (reduce post-sale churn risk)

---

## Sales Call Structure

Every sales call follows this agenda:

1. **Set the agenda** (1 min) — "I'd like to cover X, Y, Z today — does that work for you?"
2. **Their update** (3-5 min) — "What's changed since we last spoke?"
3. **Core discussion** (20-30 min) — Discovery, demo, or negotiation depending on stage
4. **Summarize & confirm understanding** (5 min) — Reflect back what you heard
5. **Next steps** (3 min) — Always close with a specific, committed next action

---

## Win/Loss Framework

After every closed deal (won or lost), document:
- **Why we won/lost**: Top 3 reasons
- **Competitor involved**: Who and what was their winning angle
- **What we'd do differently**: Specific changes for next time
- **Deal metrics**: Days in pipeline, number of touches, stakeholders engaged

## Discounting Policy

| Discount Level | Authorization Required |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 0-10% | Rep authority |
| 11-20% | Manager approval |
| 21-30% | VP Sales approval |
| 31%+ | CEO + Finance sign-off |

**Always** tie discount to a concession: annual prepay, extended term, expanded seats, or reference/case study commitment.
