## SPIN Question Bank

Use these as a guide — do not read them verbatim. Listen actively and follow threads.
Aim to ask 8-12 questions total. Quality over quantity.

---

### S — Situation Questions (ask 2-3 maximum)

*Purpose: Establish factual baseline. Keep brief — prospects find excessive situational questions annoying.*

**Team & structure**:
- "How is your sales team structured today — SDRs, AEs, CSMs?"
- "How many reps are you running currently, and are you planning to grow that this year?"
- "What markets or segments are you focused on right now?"

**Current tools & process**:
- "Walk me through your current sales tech stack — what are the core tools your reps use day to day?"
- "How do you currently run your pipeline reviews and forecast calls?"
- "How does deal information get updated in your CRM — is that mostly rep-driven or automated?"

**Context for this conversation**:
- "What prompted you to take this call today? Was there a specific trigger?"
- "Have you looked at solutions like ours before? What came of that?"

---

### P — Problem Questions (ask 4-6 — this is the core)

*Purpose: Surface explicit and implicit pains. Let the prospect do the talking. Follow threads.*

**Pipeline & forecast accuracy**:
- "How confident are you in your pipeline data on any given day — really confident, or are there gaps?"
- "When your CRO asks for the forecast on a Friday, how do you feel about the numbers you provide?"
- "How often does a deal slip that you didn't see coming? What typically causes that?"
- "If I asked your reps how current their CRM data is right now, what would they say?"

**Rep productivity & admin burden**:
- "Where do your reps spend time that isn't actual selling? What's eating their day?"
- "How much time per week would you estimate each rep spends on CRM updates and admin?"
- "What's the biggest drag on your team's productivity that you haven't been able to fix yet?"

**Ramp & onboarding**:
- "How long does it take a new rep to hit full productivity after joining your team?"
- "What's the biggest obstacle to getting new reps ramped faster?"
- "When a top rep leaves, how long does it take to recover that lost revenue?"

**Visibility & management**:
- "How much visibility do you have into what your reps are actually doing day to day — calls, emails, pipeline activity?"
- "When a deal goes dark, how early do you typically know about it?"
- "What does your coaching process look like — how do you identify reps who need help before it's too late?"

---

### I — Implication Questions (ask 2-4 — create urgency)

*Purpose: Expand the pain. Help the prospect feel the cost of inaction. Do not rush here.*

**Financial implications**:
- "If each rep is losing 6 hours a week to admin work, what does that cost you across the team in a year? [pause — let them calculate]"
- "When a deal slips a quarter unexpectedly, what's the downstream impact on your revenue plan?"
- "How does inaccurate forecasting affect your ability to plan hiring or make investment decisions?"

**Organizational implications**:
- "When the forecast misses, who feels that internally — just you, or does it create pressure up the chain?"
- "How does your team feel about the current tools? Is there frustration you're managing?"
- "If this problem persists through your next hiring wave, how does that change the impact?"

**Competitive implications**:
- "If your competitors are solving this and you're not, what does that mean for your ability to compete?"
- "What happens to your market position if your ramp times stay at {{X}} months while others get to {{Y}}?"

**Urgency questions**:
- "Is there a specific date or event that makes solving this more time-sensitive — a new initiative, a board review, a contract renewal?"
- "If you don't have a solution in place by {{TIMELINE}}, what does that mean for your team?"

---

### N — Need-Payoff Questions (ask 2-3 — let them sell themselves)

*Purpose: Get the prospect to articulate the value of solving the problem in their own words.*

- "If you had real-time pipeline accuracy, how would that change your Monday forecast call?"
- "What would it mean for your team if each rep got 5 more hours per week back for actual selling?"
- "If you could see a deal going sideways 3 weeks earlier, what would that be worth to you — in one specific deal you lost last quarter?"
- "How important is solving this before your next hiring push?"
- "If I could show you a way to cut your ramp time by 6 weeks per rep, is that a business case worth exploring?"

## Active Listening Cues

Watch for these signals and dig in when you hear them:

| Signal | Follow-up |
|--------|-----------|
| "It's a bit of a mess right now" | "Tell me more about what the mess looks like day to day" |
| "We've tried to fix this before" | "What happened? Why didn't the previous attempt stick?" |
| "My boss is really focused on this" | "What's driving that focus — is there a specific initiative or pressure from above?" |
| "We're looking at a few options" | "Who else are you evaluating? What are the key things you're comparing?" |
| "We need to move quickly" | "What's creating the urgency — what happens if this isn't solved by X date?" |
| "I'd need to loop in [NAME]" | "Who is [NAME] and what's their role in a decision like this?" |

---

## Economic Buyer Discovery

If the EB is not in the room, ask:

- "For a decision at this scale, who else typically needs to be involved?"
- "Does budget for this come from your team, or does it need sign-off from finance?"
- "If we get to a proposal stage, who would need to be in the room for that conversation?"
- "Is there anyone whose buy-in would be critical for this to move forward?"

**Goal**: Get a name and a path to access before the call ends.

---

## Call Close — Locking in Next Steps

Never end a discovery call without a committed next step.

**If it's a fit**:
> "Based on what you've shared, I think there's a strong case for going deeper.
> Here's what I'd suggest: [tailored demo focused on Pain 1 and Pain 2].
> I'd want to bring our SE to walk through the technical fit as well.
> Can we get something on the calendar before we hang up?"

**If fit is unclear**:
> "I want to be honest — I'm not 100% sure yet if we're the right fit for {{COMPANY_NAME}}.
> What I'd propose is a shorter 30-minute follow-up where I can show you one specific
> thing that either confirms or rules us out. Worth doing?"

**If not a fit**:
> "I appreciate your time today. Based on what you've described, I don't think we're
> the right solution for you right now — and I'd rather tell you that than waste
> your time. [Reason]. If that changes, I'm easy to find."
