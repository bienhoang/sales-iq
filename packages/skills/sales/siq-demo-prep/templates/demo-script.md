## Section 1 — Opening Recap (2 minutes)

**Goal**: Confirm shared understanding before showing anything. Get explicit buy-in.

**Script**:
> "Thanks for making time today. Before I open the product, I want to make sure
> we're focused on the right things.
>
> Based on our conversation on {{PRIOR_CALL_DATE}}, I heard three things that matter
> most to your team:
>
> First, {{PAIN_1_SUMMARY}} — which is costing roughly {{PAIN_1_IMPACT}}.
> Second, {{PAIN_2_SUMMARY}} — leading to {{PAIN_2_IMPACT}}.
> And third, {{PAIN_3_SUMMARY}}.
>
> Does that still capture the priorities? Anything shifted since we last spoke?"

**Listen for**: New stakeholders, changed priorities, competitive news, urgency shifts.

**Transition**:
> "Perfect. So today I'm going to show you specifically how we solve those three things —
> and I'll skip everything that isn't relevant to you. Sound good?"

---

## Section 2 — The Before Picture (2 minutes)

**Goal**: Name their current painful reality out loud — in their language. Create contrast for the demo.

**Script**:
> "Here's what I hear from most teams at {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s stage before they make a change.
>
> Reps are spending {{PAIN_1_TIME_COST}} every week on {{PAINFUL_ACTIVITY}}. That's
> {{ANNUAL_COST}} across your team annually — just to keep the lights on.
>
> Meanwhile, your pipeline data is only as current as the last rep who remembered to
> update their CRM. Which means your Friday forecast is built on assumptions, not facts.
>
> Does that sound familiar?"

**Expected response**: Yes, plus they'll likely add their own color. Let them talk — every detail is intel.

---

## Section 3 — The After Picture (1 minute)

**Goal**: Set the expectation before the demo. Prime them to see the contrast.

**Script**:
> "What I'm going to show you is a world where {{POSITIVE_OUTCOME_1}},
> {{POSITIVE_OUTCOME_2}}, and {{POSITIVE_OUTCOME_3}}.
>
> I'll walk through each of your three priorities. After each one, I'll pause and ask
> if it hits the mark. Fair?"

---

## Section 4 — Demo Flow (25 minutes)

### Pain 1: {{PAIN_1_TITLE}} (~8 minutes)

**Setup line**:
> "Let's start with {{PAIN_1}}. You mentioned this is eating {{PAIN_1_IMPACT}} for your team."

**Feature to show**: {{FEATURE_1}} — e.g., Automated activity capture + CRM sync

**Key clicks** (SE guide):
1. {{CLICK_1}} — show {{WHAT_IT_DEMONSTRATES}}
2. {{CLICK_2}} — show {{WHAT_IT_DEMONSTRATES}}
3. {{CLICK_3}} — show {{WHAT_IT_DEMONSTRATES}}

**Pause and confirm**:
> "Does this solve what you described? Is this the level of automation you were
> hoping for, or were you imagining something different?"

**Trap question** (if {{COMPETITOR_1}} is in evaluation):
> "When you looked at {{COMPETITOR_1}}, how did they handle {{SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY}}?
> I ask because a lot of teams find they need a connector tool in between, which
> creates its own maintenance burden."

---

### Pain 2: {{PAIN_2_TITLE}} (~8 minutes)

**Setup line**:
> "Now let me show you how we tackle {{PAIN_2}}."

**Feature to show**: {{FEATURE_2}} — e.g., AI pipeline health scoring

**Key clicks** (SE guide):
1. {{CLICK_1}}
2. {{CLICK_2}}
3. {{CLICK_3}}

**Pause and confirm**:
> "If your team had this view every Monday morning, how would that change your
> forecast call with {{EXECUTIVE}}?"

**Discovery question** (uncover deeper pain):
> "Who else on your team would use this dashboard? I'm curious whether this would
> be useful for {{OTHER_PERSONA}} as well."

---

### Pain 3: {{PAIN_3_TITLE}} (~8 minutes)

**Setup line**:
> "Last one — {{PAIN_3}}. This is usually where teams tell me they get the biggest
> aha moment."

**Feature to show**: {{FEATURE_3}} — e.g., Early deal-risk alerts

**Key clicks** (SE guide):
1. {{CLICK_1}}
2. {{CLICK_2}}
3. {{CLICK_3}}

**Pause and confirm**:
> "Based on your last two quarters, how many deals do you think you could have
> saved with this kind of early warning?"

---

## Section 5 — Breadth Pass (Optional, 3 minutes)

Only if time allows and audience is engaged. Show one additional capability not tied to the 3 pains — something that creates unexpected delight or surfaces a new use case.

> "One thing I didn't plan to show today, but since {{ATTENDEE}} mentioned {{THING}},
> let me show you this quickly..."

---

## Section 6 — Anticipated Objections

Prepare these before the meeting. Do not wait to be surprised.

### Objection 1: "We already have this in our CRM"
**Response**:
> "That's a really common starting point. The difference is that native CRM reporting
> shows you what's already happened — what we do is flag what's about to happen.
> Let me show you the specific gap [return to deal-risk alert demo]."

### Objection 2: "This looks complex to implement"
**Response**:
> "I hear that concern a lot — and it's fair given some tools in this space.
> Our typical go-live is {{DAYS}} days. The {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} team was
> fully live in {{X}} days with a two-person ops team running it.
> Want me to walk you through what implementation looks like?"

### Objection 3: "We're not sure the ROI justifies the cost"
**Response**:
> "Let's put a number on it together. You mentioned {{PAIN_1_IMPACT}}. If we
> solve even half of that, what's the annual value? [pause — let them calculate]
> Our Pro tier starts at ${{PRICE}}/month. Does that math work?"

---

## Section 7 — Close (5 minutes)

**Confirm the technical win**:
> "Based on what you've seen today, does this address the three things you came in
> with? Is there anything you saw that doesn't fit how your team works?"

**Surface remaining concerns**:
> "What questions do you have that we haven't answered yet?"

**Establish next steps**:
> "What would you need to feel confident about moving to the next stage?
> [listen] — Great. From our side, the logical next step would be {{NEXT_STEP}}.
> Does that make sense?"

**Book the next meeting before leaving**:
> "Can we put something on the calendar now? I'd rather not leave this open-ended.
> Does {{DAY}} or {{DAY}} work for a {{NEXT_MEETING_TYPE}}?"
