## Executive Summary

{{CLIENT_COMPANY}} is losing an estimated **${{TOTAL_PAIN_VALUE}}/year** to three compounding problems: {{PAIN_1_SHORT}}, {{PAIN_2_SHORT}}, and {{PAIN_3_SHORT}}.

This proposal outlines how {{YOUR_COMPANY}}'s {{PRODUCT_NAME}} platform eliminates these inefficiencies — delivering a projected **{{ROI_PERCENTAGE}}% ROI in year one** with a payback period of **{{PAYBACK_MONTHS}} months**.

**The ask**: A {{TERM_LENGTH}}-year agreement at **${{TOTAL_ACV}}/year**, starting {{PROPOSED_START_DATE}}.

## 1. The Problem

*Based on our conversations on {{DISCOVERY_DATE}} and {{DEMO_DATE}}.*

### 1.1 {{PAIN_1_TITLE}}

**What's happening**: {{PAIN_1_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION}}

**Quantified impact**:
- {{PAIN_1_METRIC}} — e.g., "Your {{HEADCOUNT}} reps each spend an estimated {{HOURS}}/week on manual CRM updates"
- Annualized cost: **${{PAIN_1_ANNUAL_COST}}**
  - Calculation: {{HOURS}} hrs/week × {{TEAM_SIZE}} reps × 52 weeks × ${{FULLY_LOADED_HOURLY_RATE}}/hr

**Current workaround**: {{HOW_THEY_HANDLE_IT_TODAY}}

**Cost of inaction**: If this remains unsolved through your next hiring wave of {{PLANNED_HIRES}} reps, the annual cost grows to **${{PROJECTED_FUTURE_COST}}**.

---

### 1.2 {{PAIN_2_TITLE}}

**What's happening**: {{PAIN_2_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION}}

**Quantified impact**:
- {{PAIN_2_METRIC}}
- Annualized cost: **${{PAIN_2_ANNUAL_COST}}**
  - Calculation: {{PAIN_2_CALCULATION}}

**Current workaround**: {{HOW_THEY_HANDLE_IT_TODAY}}

---

### 1.3 {{PAIN_3_TITLE}}

**What's happening**: {{PAIN_3_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION}}

**Quantified impact**:
- {{PAIN_3_METRIC}}
- Annualized cost: **${{PAIN_3_ANNUAL_COST}}**

---

### Total Addressable Pain

| Pain | Annual Cost |
|------|------------|
| {{PAIN_1_TITLE}} | ${{PAIN_1_ANNUAL_COST}} |
| {{PAIN_2_TITLE}} | ${{PAIN_2_ANNUAL_COST}} |
| {{PAIN_3_TITLE}} | ${{PAIN_3_ANNUAL_COST}} |
| **Total** | **${{TOTAL_PAIN_VALUE}}/year** |

## 3. Why {{YOUR_COMPANY}}

### Proof: {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}}

- **{{RESULT_2}}** — e.g., "Pipeline forecast accuracy improved from 61% → 94%"
- **{{RESULT_3}}** — e.g., "3 at-risk deals recovered via early deal-health alerts in first 90 days"
- **Net impact**: ${{CASE_STUDY_VALUE}} annual value; payback in {{PAYBACK_MONTHS}} months

## 4. ROI Model

### Year 1 Value Analysis

**Pain eliminated**:
| Source | Annual Value |
|--------|-------------|
