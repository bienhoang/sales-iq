# Common B2B SaaS Objections — Top 15

Reference file for `siq-objection-handling`. Each objection includes root cause, reframe, and response pattern.

---

## Category: Price / Budget

### Objection 1 — "It's too expensive"

**Root cause**: ROI not established; prospect comparing price without value context.

**Empathize**: "I hear you — and I want to make sure the number makes sense before we go any further."

**Reframe**: "The question isn't whether ${{PRICE}} is a lot — it's whether it's a lot compared to what the problem is costing you. You mentioned {{PAIN}} is costing roughly ${{PAIN_COST}}/year. At ${{PRICE}}/year, we're talking about a {{PAYBACK_MONTHS}}-month payback. Does the math hold up on your end?"

**Evidence**: "{{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} had the same reaction initially. When we built the ROI model together, they realized the cost of doing nothing was 4× the cost of the solution. They signed within two weeks."

**Close**: "If I can show you a model where the ROI is clear within 6 months, would that change how you're thinking about the investment?"

**Trap to avoid**: Never offer a discount before building the value case. Discounting before ROI is established signals that the price was wrong to begin with.

---

### Objection 2 — "We don't have budget right now"

**Root cause**: Budget is either truly unavailable, not yet allocated, or the prospect doesn't believe the ROI justifies the fight.

**Empathize**: "Totally understand — budget cycles are real, and I don't want to push you into a conversation you're not ready for."

**Reframe**: "Help me understand — is it that there's literally no budget allocated, or that budget exists but this isn't currently in the plan? The answer changes what we'd do next."

**Evidence** (if budget exists but unallocated): "A lot of our customers fund this by reallocating from tools that overlap with what we do. Others get budget approved mid-cycle by showing the cost of delay — I can help you build that business case for your CFO if useful."

**Close**: "What would need to be true for this to make it into the next budget cycle? And when does that cycle open?"

**Trap to avoid**: Don't accept "no budget" as a final answer without understanding the budget cycle. If budget opens in Q2, start building the case now.

---

### Objection 3 — "Can you do better on price?"

**Root cause**: Standard negotiating move. Prospect may have room to pay full price but always tries.

**Empathize**: "I appreciate you asking directly — I'd rather have this conversation openly."

**Reframe**: "I want to get you the best possible terms, and I can often work with you on price — but I need something in return to go to my leadership. Help me understand what you're looking for."

**Evidence**: "The levers I typically have are: annual prepay gets you {{X}}% off, a multi-year term gets you {{Y}}% off, and if you're open to being a reference customer, I can sometimes unlock additional flexibility. What matters most to you?"

**Close**: "If I can get to ${{TARGET_PRICE}}, can you commit to signing by {{DATE}}? I need a firm close date to take to my manager."

**Trap to avoid**: Never give a discount without getting a concession — longer term, case study rights, reference call, expanded scope. Unilateral discounts erode perceived value and set a bad precedent for renewal.

---

## Category: Timing

### Objection 4 — "The timing isn't right / Let's revisit next quarter"

**Root cause**: Either genuine capacity issue, budget cycle misalignment, or a buried concern they haven't named.

**Empathize**: "I completely respect that — I'd rather wait for the right moment than rush you into something."

**Reframe**: "I want to make sure I understand what's driving the timing. Is it a budget issue, bandwidth on your team, or something specific about where your priorities are right now? The reason I ask is the answer tells me whether 'next quarter' is real or whether there's something we should address now."

**Evidence**: "In my experience, 'next quarter' often means 'we haven't made the case internally yet.' I can help with that — I've built business cases for teams in similar positions. Would it be useful for me to put together a one-pager that makes the case for your leadership?"

**Close**: "Can we put a 20-minute call on the calendar for {{SPECIFIC_DATE}} — first week of next quarter? I'll come prepared with the ROI model and we can decide together whether the timing is right."

**Trap to avoid**: Don't accept a vague "next quarter" without a specific date on the calendar. If they won't commit to a future date, the deal is likely dead — better to know now.

### Objection 5 — "We just implemented another tool / We're in the middle of a rollout"

**Root cause**: Legitimate capacity concern; org change fatigue is real.

**Empathize**: "That makes complete sense — change fatigue is a real thing, and rolling out multiple platforms at once rarely goes well."

**Reframe**: "What I'm curious about is: does the tool you just implemented actually solve {{SPECIFIC_PAIN}}, or does it solve a different problem? A lot of teams find they still have a gap after rollout."

**Evidence**: "{{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} was mid-rollout of a new CRM when they evaluated us. Because we integrate natively with {{CRM}}, the implementation was actually faster than they expected — and we went live in parallel without disrupting the CRM rollout."

**Close**: "What if we scoped a phased approach that doesn't start until {{THEIR_ROLLOUT}} is complete? I can put together a timeline that works around your current initiative."

---

## Category: Competitor / Status Quo

### Objection 6 — "We're already using {{COMPETITOR}}"

**Root cause**: Incumbent advantage; switching cost fear; or genuine satisfaction with current tool.

**Empathize**: "That makes sense — {{COMPETITOR}} is a solid platform, and switching tools has real costs."

**Reframe**: "Can I ask — are you using {{COMPETITOR}} because it solves {{SPECIFIC_PAIN}} better than anything else, or more because it's what you inherited and it works well enough? Those are two very different answers."

**Evidence**: "We see {{COMPETITOR}} a lot in evaluations. Where we typically win is {{SPECIFIC_DIFFERENTIATOR}} — something {{COMPETITOR}} handles through a third-party connector rather than natively. For teams where {{CAPABILITY}} matters, that's usually the deciding factor."

**Close**: "Would you be open to a 30-minute comparison specifically on {{PAIN_AREA}}? If {{COMPETITOR}} is genuinely better for your use case, I'll tell you — I'd rather lose a deal honestly than win it on false pretenses."

**Trap to avoid**: Never trash the competitor. It makes you look insecure and puts the prospect in a defensive position since they chose them.

---

### Objection 7 — "We're happy with how we're doing it today"

**Root cause**: No pain acknowledged yet, or the pain isn't felt by this contact (wrong stakeholder).

**Empathize**: "That's great to hear — and honestly, if what you have today is working, I don't want to fix something that isn't broken."

**Reframe**: "Help me understand 'happy' — happy compared to what you had before, or genuinely optimized for where you're trying to go? A lot of teams are happy in the same way they're happy driving a car with a check engine light — it still runs, but something's building."

**Evidence**: "When I talk to {{ROLE_TYPE}} leaders at your stage, the #1 thing they say they wish they'd done earlier is {{RELEVANT_THING}}. Not because their old way was broken — but because they didn't realize how much they were leaving on the table."

**Close**: "What would need to be measurably different for you to consider that today's approach isn't working well enough? I'd love to know what 'excellent' looks like for you."

---

### Objection 8 — "We're evaluating multiple vendors — we'll get back to you"

**Root cause**: Either genuine multi-vendor evaluation, or a polite way to go dark.

**Empathize**: "That's a smart approach — you should evaluate options for a decision this size."

**Reframe**: "I want to make sure we're competing on the right criteria. Can you share what your evaluation framework looks like and what the top 2-3 things you're scoring vendors on are? I'd rather know now if there's a category where we're not competitive."

**Evidence**: "Most of our customers evaluated 3-4 vendors. The ones who chose us typically weighted {{OUR_STRENGTH}} most heavily. If that's true for {{COMPANY}}, I think we'll come out ahead — but I'd rather confirm that than assume it."

**Close**: "When are you targeting a decision? And who's on the evaluation committee? I'd love to make sure we're in front of the right people before you narrow the field."

---

## Category: Risk / Trust

### Objection 9 — "We're worried about implementation risk"

**Root cause**: Past bad experience with a different vendor, or genuine complexity concern.

**Empathize**: "Implementation risk is a completely legitimate concern — especially if you've been burned before. I want to address that directly."

**Reframe**: "The question is whether the risk is inherent to platforms like ours, or specific to vendors who don't handle it well. Let me show you what our implementation process looks like."

**Evidence**: "Our average go-live time for a team your size is {{X}} days. {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} — {{SIMILAR_SIZE}} team — went live in {{Y}} days. I can connect you with their ops lead if you'd like to hear it directly."

**Close**: "Would it help to start with a phased pilot — say, 5 reps for 30 days — so you can validate before full rollout? We can structure the contract that way if it reduces your risk."

---

### Objection 10 — "We're concerned about data security / compliance"

**Root cause**: Legitimate compliance requirement, or using security as a stall.

**Empathize**: "Security is non-negotiable for us too — and I'd be worried if you weren't asking this question."

**Reframe**: "Can you tell me specifically what compliance requirements you need to meet? SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, data residency? I want to make sure I give you accurate information rather than a general answer."

**Evidence**: "We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and offer EU data residency for customers who require it. I can have our security team send you our trust documentation today — and if you need a formal security review, we've built a process that typically completes in {{X}} business days."

**Close**: "Can I connect you with our security team directly? They're available for a 30-minute call and can answer questions your IT team might have more specifically than I can."

---

### Objection 11 — "What if we outgrow it / What's your enterprise roadmap?"

**Root cause**: Prospect is thinking long-term; doesn't want to switch vendors again in 18 months.

**Empathize**: "That's exactly the right question to ask — nobody wants to implement a platform and then migrate again in two years."

**Reframe**: "Tell me what 'outgrowing it' looks like for you — is it seat count, data volume, feature sophistication, or geographic expansion? Each of those has a different answer."

**Evidence**: "{{ENTERPRISE_CUSTOMER}} started with us at {{SEAT_COUNT}} seats and is now at {{LARGER_COUNT}} — our platform scaled with them through a Series C and international expansion. I can share our product roadmap under NDA if that helps."

**Close**: "Would a conversation with our VP of Product be useful? I can arrange a 30-minute roadmap preview specifically for {{COMPANY}}'s growth trajectory."

---

## Category: Internal / Stakeholder

### Objection 12 — "I need to get buy-in from my team / boss"

**Root cause**: Champion doesn't have authority, or needs internal support they don't yet have.

**Empathize**: "Totally makes sense — a decision like this should have the right people involved."

**Reframe**: "I'd love to help you make the internal case. The most effective thing is usually to bring the key stakeholders into a focused session so they can see it firsthand — is that something we could arrange?"

**Evidence**: "When {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}}'s champion was in a similar position, we ran a 45-minute stakeholder session that included their CFO and VP Ops. Having everyone in the room at once actually shortened their decision timeline by 3 weeks."

**Close**: "Who are the 2-3 people whose support you need? Let me put together a stakeholder session agenda — you present it internally and we show up ready to answer their specific questions."

---

### Objection 13 — "Our IT / legal team needs to approve this first"

**Root cause**: Legitimate process step, often used to stall or avoid a decision.

**Empathize**: "Of course — and the earlier we bring them in, the better. Surprises at the legal stage are what kill timelines."

**Reframe**: "Let's get them involved now rather than at the end. Most of our legal and security reviews take {{X}} business days when we start early. If we wait until after you've decided, it can add weeks to the timeline."

**Evidence**: "I can send our standard security questionnaire responses, SOC 2 report, and redlined MSA to your IT and legal teams today. We've been through this process with {{NUMBER}} customers and have pre-negotiated language for most standard requests."

**Close**: "Can you introduce me to your IT security lead and legal contact this week? The sooner we start the review, the sooner it's off the critical path."

---

## Category: Product / Fit

### Objection 14 — "We'd need {{FEATURE}} to make this work"

**Root cause**: Genuine feature gap, or a requirement shaped by a competitor's demo.

**Empathize**: "That's helpful to know — let me make sure I understand exactly what you need before I respond."

**Reframe**: "Tell me more about the specific use case that requires {{FEATURE}}. Sometimes what teams ask for and what they actually need are slightly different, and there may be a way we solve it that we haven't shown you yet."

**Evidence** (if on roadmap): "{{FEATURE}} is on our Q{{X}} roadmap. I can share the timeline under NDA and potentially include an early access commitment in the contract."

**Evidence** (if not on roadmap): "We don't have {{FEATURE}} today, and I won't mislead you on that. What I'd want to understand is: is this a must-have that blocks the deal, or a nice-to-have? And what workaround do you use today?"

**Close**: "If {{FEATURE}} is a hard blocker, let me be honest about our timeline. If it's not a blocker, can we agree to move forward with a roadmap commitment documented in the contract?"

---

### Objection 15 — "We tried something like this before and it didn't work"

**Root cause**: Past failure with a similar solution; fear of repeating the mistake.

**Empathize**: "I really appreciate you sharing that — and I'd rather understand what went wrong than pretend it didn't happen."

**Reframe**: "Help me understand what 'didn't work' looked like — was it the technology, the implementation, the adoption, or the internal change management? The answer matters a lot, because those are very different problems with different solutions."

**Evidence**: "Most of the teams who come to us after a failed implementation tell us the issue was {{COMMON_ROOT_CAUSE — e.g., lack of exec sponsorship, wrong tool for their process, bad vendor support}}. The way we address that is {{SPECIFIC_APPROACH}}. I can walk you through how we handled this specifically for {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} who had a similar experience."

**Close**: "What would need to be true about our approach — or our contract — to make you feel confident this time would be different? I'd rather design the engagement around your specific concerns than give you a generic answer."
