## Pre-Emption Strategy

These objections should be proactively addressed **before** they're raised — in the proposal, during the demo, or in champion prep conversations.

### In the Proposal
- Address {{OBJECTION_1}} in Section 3 (Why Us) before the prospect reads the pricing page
- Include the ROI model to pre-empt price objections
- Add a "What happens if you do nothing?" section to create urgency

### In the Demo
- When showing {{FEATURE}}, immediately address the likely {{OBJECTION}} by saying:
  > "I know some teams worry about {{CONCERN}} when they see this — here's how we handle it..."

### Champion Prep
Arm your champion with these talking points for internal objections:

| Internal Objection | Champion Talking Point |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "We already have {{TOOL}}" | "{{TOOL}} solves X, this solves Y — they're complementary, not duplicative" |
| "We can't afford it right now" | "The cost of doing nothing is ${{PAIN_COST}}/year — here's the ROI model" |
| "Bad timing" | "We lose ${{MONTHLY_COST}} every month we wait — what would make timing better?" |
| "We tried this before" | "That was {{COMPETITOR/APPROACH}} — here's how this is different: {{DIFFERENTIATOR}}" |

## Objection Log

## Negotiation Guardrails

If price negotiation begins, reference these hard limits before making any concessions:

| Concession | My Authority | Needs Manager | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Discount 1-10% | Yes | No | Must get something in return |
| Discount 11-20% | No | Yes — {{MANAGER}} | Justify with ACV floor |
| Payment terms > Net 30 | No | Yes — Finance | Check cash flow impact |
| Remove onboarding fee | No | Yes | Reduces implementation quality risk |
| Monthly billing (annual deal) | No | Yes | Price goes up 17% to compensate |
| Multi-year price lock | Yes | No | Standard offer for 2-3 year terms |

**My floor for this deal**: ${{FLOOR_ACV}} ACV, {{MIN_TERM}} term minimum.

---

## When to Escalate

Escalate to your manager immediately if:
- Economic buyer says the deal is dead (not stalled — dead)
- Prospect reveals a compliance requirement we cannot meet
- Competitor has offered pricing below our floor
- Champion departure and no backup identified
- Legal redlines exceed 5 non-standard clauses

**Manager escalation contact**: {{MANAGER_NAME}} — {{MANAGER_PHONE}}
