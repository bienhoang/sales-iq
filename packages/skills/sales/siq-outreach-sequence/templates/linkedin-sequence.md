# LinkedIn Outreach Sequence Template

**Target Persona**: {{PERSONA}} — e.g., Head of Revenue Operations at mid-market SaaS
**Primary Pain**: {{PAIN}} — e.g., No single source of truth for pipeline data across tools
**Trigger Event**: {{TRIGGER}} — e.g., Recently promoted; posted about scaling RevOps
**Sequence Length**: 5 touches over 21 days
**Goal**: Move conversation to email or book a call

---

## Pre-Sequence Checklist

Before sending Touch 1, complete these:
- [ ] Profile optimized: headline reads as value proposition, not job title
- [ ] Recent activity: liked or commented on 1-2 of their posts in the past week (genuine engagement only)
- [ ] Research done: reviewed their profile, recent posts, company news, and shared connections
- [ ] Email parallel: coordinate with cold email sequence — LinkedIn and email should complement, not duplicate

---

## Sequence Overview

| Touch | Day | Type | Character Limit | Angle |

| 3 | 8 | DM | 500 chars | Value — share relevant insight |
| 4 | 14 | DM | 500 chars | Soft ask — relevance check |
| 5 | 21 | DM | 300 chars | Graceful close |

## Touch 1 — Day 1 — Connection Request

**Character limit**: 300 (LinkedIn hard limit — every word counts)

**Template A** — Reaction to their content:
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — your post on {{TOPIC}} was spot on. The point about {{SPECIFIC_INSIGHT}}
resonated with what I'm hearing from RevOps leaders at similar-stage companies.
Would love to connect and keep following your thinking.

— {{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Template B** — Shared context/community:
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — we're both connected to {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} and I've been following
{{COMPANY}}'s growth. I work with {{ROLE_TYPE}} leaders on {{RELEVANT_TOPIC}} and thought
it'd be worth connecting. Hope that's OK.

— {{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Template C** — Trigger event:
```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — congrats on the {{PROMOTION / FUNDING / LAUNCH}}. Exciting time for
{{COMPANY}}. I work with teams at your stage on {{RELEVANT_AREA}} and thought connecting
made sense. No pitch — just relevant people worth knowing.

— {{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Never mention your company's product name
- Never use "I wanted to reach out" — just reach out
- If you have no specific angle, wait until you do — a blank request is better than a generic one

---

## Touch 2 — Day 3 — First DM (Post-Connection)

**Send**: 24-48h after they accept. Sooner if they engaged with your request note.

**Template**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — thanks for connecting.

I'll skip the pitch. I'm curious about something: when {{COMPANY}}'s pipeline data
lives across {{TOOL_1}}, {{TOOL_2}}, and spreadsheets — how do you keep a single
source of truth for forecasting?

Asking because it's the #1 thing RevOps leaders at your stage tell me keeps them
up at night. Wondering if it's the same for you.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Alt opening** (if they posted recently):
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — thanks for connecting. Saw your post on {{TOPIC}} and it sparked a question:

[question relevant to their post and your solution area]

Curious how you're thinking about it at {{COMPANY}}.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Open with gratitude, then pivot immediately to them
- End with an open question — not a pitch, not a CTA
- No links in Touch 2 — too early

---

## Touch 3 — Day 8 — Value Drop

**Send**: Only if Touch 2 was read (use LinkedIn read receipts if available). If no read, send anyway.

**Template**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — following up on my question. Whether or not it resonates,
thought this might be useful:

[One-sentence description of resource — e.g., "We put together a benchmark on how
mid-market RevOps teams are structuring their pipeline review cadence in 2024."]

[Link]

No form. Just the data. Figured it was relevant given what you're building at {{COMPANY}}.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Alt — React to their recent content**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — saw you posted about {{TOPIC}} yesterday. This framework we use
with similar teams might be relevant: [link or 2-3 bullet insight]

Happy to dig into how it applies to {{COMPANY}} if useful.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Resource must be genuinely useful regardless of whether they buy
- Keep it under 100 words
- One link maximum

---

## Touch 4 — Day 14 — Soft Ask

**Template**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — I'll be direct.

I think there's a real chance we could help {{COMPANY}} get cleaner pipeline data and
save your team meaningful hours every week. I've seen it work at {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}}
— {{RESULT_METRIC}} in about 60 days.

Worth 15 minutes to see if it's relevant? If not, totally fine — just say the word
and I'll stop cluttering your inbox.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Specific time ask (15 min, not "a quick chat")
- Name a comparable company + specific result
- Give them an easy out — reduces friction and often generates replies either way

---

## Touch 5 — Day 21 — Graceful Close

**Character target**: Under 150 words. Keep it human and memorable.

**Template**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}} — last note from me.

I've genuinely enjoyed following your posts on {{TOPIC}}. You're thinking about
{{RELEVANT_AREA}} in a way I don't see often.

If {{PAIN_TOPIC}} ever becomes a bigger priority at {{COMPANY}}, I'm easy to find.
Until then — rooting for what you're building.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- No ask in the break-up message
- Reference something genuine about their content or work
- Leave a positive impression — they may forward your name to someone else

---

## Parallel Email Coordination

LinkedIn and email sequences should run together but feel independent:

| Day | LinkedIn | Email |
|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | Connection request | Send Touch 1 email |
| 3 | DM Touch 2 | No email (avoid doubling up same day) |
| 5 | — | Send Touch 2 email (value drop) |
| 8 | DM Touch 3 | — |
| 11 | — | Send Touch 3 email |
| 14 | DM Touch 4 | Send Touch 4 email |
| 17 | — | Send Touch 5 email |
| 21 | DM Touch 5 (break-up) | Send Touch 6 email |

**Rule**: If they reply on either channel, pause the other immediately and take it to a human response.
