## Touch 1 — Day 1 — Pattern Interrupt

**Subject**: `Your reps are losing {{X}} hours a week`
*Alt subjects*:
- `{{COMPANY}}'s pipeline problem`
- `Quick question about {{COMPANY}}'s forecast`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Most VP Sales I talk to at {{COMPANY_TYPE}} companies are dealing with the same problem:
reps spend more time updating the CRM than actually selling.

At {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}}, it was eating 7 hours per rep per week — before they fixed it.

Worth 15 minutes to show you what they did?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{TITLE}} | {{COMPANY}}
{{PHONE}}
```

**Timing note**: Send Tuesday–Thursday, 8–9am prospect's local time.
**Success metric**: 35%+ open rate, 3%+ reply rate.

---

## Touch 2 — Day 3 — Value Drop (No Ask)

**Subject**: `{{INDUSTRY}} sales benchmark data (no pitch)`
*Alt subjects*:
- `Thought you'd find this useful, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
- `Data from 200 {{INDUSTRY}} sales teams`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Sharing this with no agenda — we just published a benchmark report on sales productivity
across {{INDUSTRY}} companies at your stage.

Three findings stood out:
• Top quartile reps spend 68% of time in direct selling activities vs. 52% average
• Companies with automated pipeline hygiene close 23% more deals annually
• The biggest time sink: manual data entry (avg. 5.8 hrs/rep/week)

Full report here: [link] — no form, just the data.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing note**: Send 48h after Touch 1 regardless of open/click status.
**Success metric**: Click-through on the resource link.

## Touch 3 — Day 6 — Social Proof

**Subject**: `How {{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} cut rep admin time by 60%`
*Alt subjects*:
- `{{RESULT_METRIC}} in 90 days — here's how`
- `{{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} had the same problem`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

{{CASE_STUDY_COMPANY}} — a {{COMPANY_SIZE}} {{INDUSTRY}} company — was losing nearly
$400K/year in rep productivity to manual admin work.

In 90 days after deploying our platform:
• Admin time dropped from 7.2 → 2.8 hours/rep/week
• Pipeline data accuracy went from 61% → 94%
• 3 deals were saved by early deal-health alerts the team would have missed

Happy to walk you through what they did in 15 minutes.

Does {{DAY}} or {{DAY}} work for a quick call?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing note**: Include a specific case study company (anonymize if needed with "a Series B HR-tech company").
**Success metric**: Direct reply or calendar booking.

---

## Touch 4 — Day 9 — New Angle

**Subject**: `The forecast accuracy problem at {{COMPANY}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `{{FIRST_NAME}}, is forecast accuracy a challenge for your team?`
- `Missing Q{{QUARTER}} — is it a data problem?`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Sent a couple of notes — figured I'd try a different angle.

Beyond admin time, the teams I talk to at your stage say forecast accuracy is their
#1 headache. When pipeline data is stale, the forecast is fiction.

I'm curious — when your CRO asks for a pipeline call on Friday, how confident are
you in the numbers your team provides?

If there's any doubt, that's where we usually find the real problem.

Worth 15 minutes?

{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. If this just isn't a priority right now, totally understand — just let me know
and I'll stop bothering you.
```

**Timing note**: The P.S. line invites a "no" — that's intentional. It filters and often generates replies.
**Success metric**: Any reply, even a "not now" is pipeline data.

---

## Touch 5 — Day 13 — Personal + Specific

**Subject**: `Saw your post on {{TOPIC}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `Re: {{COMPANY}}'s {{RECENT_NEWS}}`
- `{{FIRST_NAME}} — after your {{EVENT}} announcement`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

Saw your {{POST / INTERVIEW / ANNOUNCEMENT}} about {{SPECIFIC_TOPIC}} — {{GENUINE_REACTION}}.

It made me think about what {{COMPANY}} is building right now. You're scaling fast —
that's exactly when pipeline visibility becomes the difference between hitting plan
and scrambling at quarter-end.

I'll keep this short: would 15 minutes this week be worth it to see if we can give
your team back 5+ hours/rep/week?

If not, no hard feelings — just say the word.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing note**: This touch requires real personalization. If you can't find a genuine reference, swap to an industry-trend angle instead.

---

## Touch 6 — Day 17 — Direct Ask

**Subject**: `Last note on this, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `Being direct, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
- `One more shot — then I'll leave you alone`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I've sent a few notes and haven't heard back. I'll be direct:

I genuinely think we can help {{COMPANY}} recover meaningful selling time for your reps
and give you a forecast you can actually trust.

If that's not interesting, that's completely fine — I'd rather know than keep guessing.

If there's even a 10% chance it's relevant, I think 15 minutes is worth it.

Thursday or Friday this week — does either work?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Timing note**: Transparency and directness often unlock replies that politeness couldn't.

---

## Touch 7 — Day 21 — Break-Up

**Subject**: `Closing the loop, {{FIRST_NAME}}`
*Alt subjects*:
- `Removing you from my list`
- `Goodbye (for now)`

**Body**:
```
{{FIRST_NAME}},

I'll stop reaching out after this — I don't want to be a nuisance.

If things change at {{COMPANY}} — new initiative, different quarter, or just a better time —
I'm easy to find. {{YOUR_EMAIL}} or just reply here.

Rooting for {{COMPANY}} regardless.

{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. If you have 30 seconds, I'm curious: wrong timing, wrong message, or just not
relevant? Even a one-word reply helps me improve. No pressure.
```

**Timing note**: The P.S. question generates replies ~15% of the time. Those replies are gold for improving future sequences.
**Success metric**: Any reply — even negative — is a win at this stage.

## Sequence Notes

- **Volume**: Run no more than 50 new prospects through a sequence per rep per week to maintain quality
- **A/B testing**: Test subject lines on touches 1 and 6 — highest leverage points
- **Pause rule**: If prospect opens Touch 1 but doesn't reply, do NOT skip Touch 2 — nurture the warm signal
- **Reply handling**: Any reply (even negative) should exit the automation and go to a human immediately
