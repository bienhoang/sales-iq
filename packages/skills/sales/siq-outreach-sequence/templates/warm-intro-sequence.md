# Warm Introduction Sequence Template

**Target Persona**: {{PERSONA}} — e.g., VP Sales at growth-stage B2B SaaS
**Mutual Connection**: {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} — e.g., Sarah Chen, former colleague / investor
**Primary Pain**: {{PAIN}} — e.g., Pipeline visibility gaps causing forecast misses
**Sequence Length**: 4 touches over 14 days
**Goal**: Book a 20-minute exploratory call

## Why Warm Intros Convert Better

Warm introductions convert to meetings at 3-5x the rate of cold outreach. The mutual connection provides:
- **Trust transfer**: Their credibility vouches for yours
- **Context**: Prospect knows why you're relevant before you explain
- **Obligation**: Social norm to at least respond

**Use this template when**: A mutual connection has agreed to introduce you and either made the intro or given you permission to reach out referencing them.

---

## Pre-Sequence: Requesting the Introduction

### Step 1 — Identify the Right Connector
Before asking for an intro, confirm:
- Does {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} actually have a real relationship with the prospect? (Not just a LinkedIn connection)
- Will their name carry positive weight? (A warm intro from a disliked person is a cold call with baggage)
- Can they speak to why you're relevant specifically?

### Step 2 — Request the Intro (to your mutual connection)

**Email/DM to send to {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}}**:
```
Hey {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}},

Hope things are going well at {{THEIR_COMPANY}}.

Quick ask — I noticed you're connected to {{PROSPECT_NAME}} at {{PROSPECT_COMPANY}}.
We've been working with a handful of {{INDUSTRY}} companies at their stage on
{{PAIN_AREA}}, and I think there could be a genuine fit.

Would you be comfortable doing a double opt-in intro? I don't want to put you in an
awkward spot — if you check with them first and they're open to it, I'll send you
a forwardable note to make it easy.

Either way, no pressure at all.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

### Step 3 — Forwardable Email (for mutual connection to forward)

**Keep this under 100 words. Plain text. No attachments.**:
```
[MUTUAL_CONNECTION to forward this to PROSPECT_NAME]

---

{{PROSPECT_FIRST_NAME}},

{{YOUR_NAME}} here — {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} suggested I reach out.

I work with {{ROLE_TYPE}} leaders at {{COMPANY_TYPE}} companies on {{SPECIFIC_PAIN_AREA}}.
Given what {{PROSPECT_COMPANY}} is building right now, I think there might be a relevant
conversation to be had.

Would 20 minutes be worth it to find out? Happy to work around your schedule.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{TITLE}} | {{COMPANY}}
{{EMAIL}} | {{PHONE}}
```

## Sequence Overview

| Touch | Day | Channel | Angle |
|-------|-----|---------|-------|
| 1 | 0 | Email (reply to intro thread) | Warm, specific, soft ask |
| 2 | 3 | Email (if no reply) | Add value, re-ask |
| 3 | 7 | LinkedIn DM | Different channel, keep momentum |
| 4 | 14 | Email | Graceful close |

---

## Touch 1 — Day 0 — Reply to Introduction Thread

**Send**: Within 2 hours of the intro being made. Reply directly in the intro email thread.

**Template**:
```
{{PROSPECT_FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for taking the time — and thanks to {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}} for making the connection.

{{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}} mentioned you're working through {{SPECIFIC_CHALLENGE_MUTUAL_MENTIONED}}.
That's exactly the problem we spend most of our time on — specifically helping
{{ROLE_TYPE}} teams at your stage {{SPECIFIC_OUTCOME}}.

I don't want to over-explain in an email. Would 20 minutes this week or next be
worth a quick conversation to see if there's something relevant here?

Thursday the {{DATE}} or Friday the {{DATE}} work well on my end — happy to fit
your schedule instead.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{TITLE}} | {{COMPANY}}
{{PHONE}}
```

**Rules**:
- Reply in the same thread — keeps the intro context visible
- Reference something the mutual connection specifically said, not generic praise
- Propose specific days, not "let me know what works" — removes friction
- Keep it under 120 words — respect that this is still a cold relationship

---

## Touch 2 — Day 3 — Follow-Up If No Reply

**Send**: Only if no reply to Touch 1. Move to a new email thread (break from intro thread).

**Subject**: `Following up — {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}}'s intro`

**Template**:
```
{{PROSPECT_FIRST_NAME}},

Following up on {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}}'s intro from earlier this week.

Thought this might be useful context in the meantime: [one relevant resource,
case study, or insight — 1 sentence description + link].

It's directly relevant to the {{SPECIFIC_CHALLENGE}} challenge — no form, just the data.

Still happy to find 20 minutes if you think it's worth it. If the timing is off,
totally understand — just let me know and I'll check back in next quarter.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Reference the intro again to maintain the warm context
- Add new value — don't just "bump" the previous email
- Give them an easy out ("check back next quarter") — reduces pressure, often generates a reply

---

## Touch 3 — Day 7 — LinkedIn DM

**Send**: If still no reply. Switch channels. Keep it brief.

**Template**:
```
{{PROSPECT_FIRST_NAME}} — sent a couple of emails via {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}}'s intro.
Trying LinkedIn in case email isn't the best channel.

Quick question: is {{PAIN_TOPIC}} actually a priority for {{COMPANY}} right now,
or is the timing just off?

Either answer is genuinely helpful. No pressure.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- Acknowledge you've reached out before — don't pretend this is a fresh contact
- Ask a direct question that's easy to answer yes or no
- Under 100 words

---

## Touch 4 — Day 14 — Graceful Close

**Subject**: `Closing the loop — {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}}'s intro`

**Template**:
```
{{PROSPECT_FIRST_NAME}},

Last note — I don't want to keep showing up uninvited.

If {{PAIN_TOPIC}} becomes a bigger priority at {{COMPANY}} in the future,
I'd genuinely love to connect. {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}} speaks highly of what
you're building and I can see why.

You can always find me at {{EMAIL}} or just reply here.

Best of luck with {{SPECIFIC_COMPANY_INITIATIVE}} — I'll be rooting for you.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Rules**:
- End positively — you may cross paths with this person again
- Reference something specific about their company or work
- Leave the door open without begging

---

## Post-Meeting: Thank the Connector

After any meeting booked via warm intro, send a brief thank-you to {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}}:

```
Hey {{MUTUAL_FIRST_NAME}},

Just wanted to say thanks — {{PROSPECT_NAME}} and I connected and had a great
conversation. Really appreciate you making that happen.

I'll make sure it reflects well on you.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Why this matters**: Connectors who feel appreciated become repeat referral sources. This 30-second message pays dividends.

## Warm Intro Conversion Benchmarks

| Metric | Expected Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Touch 1 reply rate | 40-60% |
| Meeting booked from sequence | 25-40% |
| Touch 2 needed | ~40% of cases |
| Touch 3+ needed | ~15% of cases |

If your warm intro reply rate is below 30%, the intro quality may be low — the connector may not have a genuine relationship with the prospect. Prioritize quality of connection over quantity.
