# Outreach Best Practices — B2B SaaS

## Core Philosophy

**You are not cold calling into a void — you are starting a conversation.** The best outreach is specific, timely, and relevant enough that the prospect wonders "how did they know?" Great research + great writing = meetings booked.

## Email Best Practices

### Subject Lines
The subject line's only job is to get the email opened. Nothing else.

**What works**:
- Specific + unexpected: "{{COMPANY}} + pipeline accuracy" (not "Improve your sales")
- Question format: "How does {{COMPANY}} handle forecast accuracy?"
- Name drop (warm signal): "Re: {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}}'s intro"
- Trigger-based: "Congrats on the Series B — quick thought"
- Provocative but honest: "Your reps are losing 6 hours/week (here's proof)"

**What kills open rates**:
- "Following up on my previous email" (use sparingly, only as last touch)
- All caps or excessive punctuation: "HUGE OPPORTUNITY!!!"
- Vague promises: "Boost your revenue with AI"
- Your company name in subject line (touch 1-3)

**Length**: 4-7 words is optimal. Under 10 always. Mobile preview shows ~35 characters.

### Email Body Rules
- **Line 1**: Must hook in one sentence. Reference their world, not yours.
- **Word count**: 75-125 words for touches 1-3. Under 150 for all emails.
- **Paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences max. White space is your friend.
- **CTA**: One ask per email. Specific and low-friction.
  - Good: "Would a 15-minute call Thursday or Friday work?"
  - Bad: "Let me know if you'd like to learn more about our solutions"
- **Signature**: Name, title, one-line company description, phone. No logo spam.
- **PS line**: Use sparingly — PS lines get read almost as often as line 1. Save for your best insight.

### Send Times (by data)
- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times**: 8-9am local time (before the day gets away), or 4-5pm (end-of-day reflection)
- **Avoid**: Monday morning (inbox backlog), Friday afternoon (checked out)
- **Enterprise deals**: Tuesday 8am performs consistently well across time zones

### Personalization Depth Tiers

| Tier | Effort | When to Use | Personalization |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | 20 min/prospect | Strategic accounts, >$50K ACV | Custom paragraph referencing their specific initiative, recent news, or published content |
| **Tier 2** | 5 min/prospect | Mid-market, $15K-$50K ACV | Trigger event + persona-specific pain swap |
| **Tier 3** | 1 min/prospect | SMB, high-volume sequences | Company name, industry, and role-specific pain inserted via variables |

## LinkedIn Best Practices

### Connection Request (300 char limit)
- Never send blank connection requests to cold prospects
- Reference a specific post they wrote, a shared group, or a mutual connection
- Do NOT pitch in the connection request — it's a handshake, not a sales deck
- Example: "Hi {{NAME}} — saw your post on pipeline forecasting challenges. Really resonated. Would love to connect with a fellow sales ops thinker."

### LinkedIn DM Sequence
- Wait 24-48h after connecting before sending first DM
- Touch 1 DM: Acknowledge the connection, ask one question or share one insight. No pitch.
- Touch 2 DM (5-7 days later): React to their recent activity or share relevant content
- Touch 3 DM (10-14 days later): Soft ask — "I think we could be relevant for {{COMPANY}} given {{PAIN}}. Worth a brief chat?"
- Maximum 3-4 DMs before moving back to email or pausing

### Profile Optimization (for sender credibility)
Before any outreach, ensure your LinkedIn profile reads like a thought leader, not a quota-chaser:
- Headline: Role + who you help + outcome (not just job title)
- Banner: Company brand or relevant visual
- About section: Written in first person, leads with who you help and how

## Warm Introduction Best Practices

### Requesting an Intro
Ask your mutual connection for a **double opt-in intro** — they check with the prospect first:
- "Hey {{MUTUAL}}, I noticed you're connected to {{PROSPECT}} at {{COMPANY}}. I think we could genuinely help them with {{SPECIFIC_PAIN}}. Would you be comfortable doing a quick intro if they're open to it? Happy to give you a forwardable email."

### Forwardable Email Template
Keep it to 4-5 sentences:
1. Who you are in one sentence
2. Why you think you're relevant to {{PROSPECT}} specifically
3. What you'd like — a 15-min call
4. No attachment, no pitch deck, no calendar link on first touch

### After the Intro is Made
- Respond to the intro thread within 2 hours
- Reference the mutual connection's specific reason for making the intro
- Propose a specific time, not an open-ended "let me know what works"

## Sequence Metrics & Benchmarks

Track these to know if your sequences are working:

| Metric | Below Average | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|--------------|---------|------|-----------|
| Email open rate | <20% | 20-30% | 30-45% | >45% |
| Email reply rate | <2% | 2-5% | 5-10% | >10% |
| LinkedIn connect rate | <15% | 15-25% | 25-35% | >35% |
| LinkedIn reply rate | <5% | 5-10% | 10-20% | >20% |
| Meeting booked rate (per sequence) | <2% | 2-5% | 5-8% | >8% |

**If open rate is low**: Fix subject lines or sender reputation
**If open rate is high but reply rate is low**: Fix body copy or CTA
**If reply rate is high but meetings not booking**: Fix qualification or offer

## Compliance & Legal

- **CAN-SPAM** (US): Include physical address and one-click unsubscribe in bulk sends
- **GDPR** (EU): Ensure legitimate interest basis for B2B outreach; honor opt-outs within 30 days
- **CASL** (Canada): Requires implied or express consent; stricter than CAN-SPAM
- Never purchase email lists from shady sources — deliverability damage is not worth it
- Always use a warmed-up sending domain for cold outreach (not your primary company domain)

## When to Stop

Stop a sequence when the prospect has:
- Explicitly asked to not be contacted
- Replied and said "not interested" (close gracefully, leave door open)
- Gone silent after 7+ touches (move to 90-day re-engage queue)

Never re-enter someone in an active sequence within 30 days of last contact.
