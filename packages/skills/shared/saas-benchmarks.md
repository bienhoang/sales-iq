## How to Use These Benchmarks

1. **Set targets**: Use "Good" as your minimum target, "Great" as aspirational
2. **Diagnose problems**: If you're "Below Average" on a key metric, investigate root cause
3. **Prioritize effort**: Metrics where you're far below average offer the best ROI for improvement
4. **Contextualize for stakeholders**: "Our email open rate is 32% vs the 20-28% industry average" is more compelling than just "32%"
5. **Adjust for your segment**: Enterprise SaaS, PLG, and high-touch sales have different benchmarks — adjust accordingly

**Important caveats**:
- Benchmarks vary significantly by industry vertical, ACV, and GTM motion
- Your 2nd quartile could be someone else's elite depending on niche
- Trend (improving vs declining) often matters more than absolute number
- Always compare against your own historical performance first, benchmarks second
