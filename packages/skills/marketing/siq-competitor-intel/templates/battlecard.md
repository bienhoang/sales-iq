## Landmine Questions

Plant these in discovery conversations to surface competitor weaknesses before the prospect mentions them:

1. "[Question that surfaces [Competitor]'s top complaint — e.g., 'How important is setup time to you? What's your timeline for seeing results?']"

2. "[Question that highlights our strength by contrast — e.g., 'How does your current solution handle [use case we do better]?']"

3. "[Question that surfaces switching cost issues — e.g., 'If you're evaluating multiple tools, what does your team's adoption timeline look like?']"

## Customer Switch Stories

Use these when prospects need social proof of successful migration:

**[Customer A]**:
Switched from [Competitor] because [reason]. Result after switching: [outcome with metric].
Contact: [Internal reference or case study link]

**[Customer B]**:
Was evaluating both [Competitor] and us. Chose us because [decision factor]. Quote: "[If available]"

## Evaluation Criteria We Should Set

When a prospect is running a structured evaluation, suggest these criteria (they favor us):

1. [Criterion 1 — e.g., "Time to first result / setup time"]
2. [Criterion 2 — e.g., "Brand consistency across outputs"]
3. [Criterion 3 — e.g., "Depth of ICP-specific customization"]
4. [Criterion 4 — e.g., "Support response time"]

**Suggested trial test**: Ask them to do [specific task] in both tools and compare. We win on [dimension].

## Do Not Say

Things that backfire or create legal/ethical risk:
- Don't claim competitor is "going out of business" or spread unverified rumors
- Don't trash their product unprompted — let the prospect bring them up
- Don't make guarantees we can't keep just to win a deal
- Don't reference confidential information from former competitor employees
