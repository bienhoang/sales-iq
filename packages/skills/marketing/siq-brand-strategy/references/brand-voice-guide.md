## Channel-Specific Tone Adjustments

### LinkedIn & Blog
- **Tone**: Thoughtful, professional, insight-driven
- **Style**: Longer sentences OK, data-backed claims, thought leadership angle
- **Example**: "We analyzed 500 SaaS onboarding flows. Here's what the top 10% do differently."

### X / Twitter
- **Tone**: Punchy, witty, conversational
- **Style**: Short sentences, hot takes welcome, quotable one-liners
- **Example**: "Your onboarding flow has 12 steps. Your users have 12 seconds of patience. Do the math."

### Instagram & TikTok
- **Tone**: Visual-first, casual, trend-aware
- **Style**: Hook in first line, emoji OK (don't overdo), relatable language
- **Example**: "POV: You just cut your onboarding from 12 steps to 3 ✂️"

### Email
- **Tone**: Personal, helpful, benefit-focused
- **Style**: Write like you're emailing a smart colleague, not a "dear valued customer"
- **Example**: "Quick one — we just shipped a feature that'll save you ~2 hours/week on reporting."

### Discord & Slack (Community)
- **Tone**: Friendly, peer-to-peer, community-native
- **Style**: Casual, use platform conventions (reactions, threads), be a member not a brand
- **Example**: "hey everyone 👋 just dropped a new integration — would love your feedback in #product-feedback"

## Writing Rules

### Always
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature
- Use active voice
- Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the reader
- Include a clear next step or CTA
- Back claims with specifics (numbers, examples, proof)

### Never
- Use "synergy," "leverage," "paradigm," or corporate buzzwords
- Start sentences with "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Use passive voice when active is clearer
- Write walls of text without line breaks
- Overpromise or use superlatives without proof ("best," "revolutionary," "#1")

## Formatting Conventions
- **Headlines**: Sentence case, benefit-driven
- **CTAs**: Action verbs + specific outcome ("Start your free trial" not "Learn more")
- **Numbers**: Use digits for impact ("3x faster" not "three times faster")
- **Lists**: Bullet points for scannability, limit to 5-7 items
