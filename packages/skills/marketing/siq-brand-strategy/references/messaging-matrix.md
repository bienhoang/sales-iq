## Matrix: ICP × Funnel Stage

### ICP 1: Growth-Stage Founder (Alex)

| Funnel Stage | Core Message | Value Prop | Proof Point | CTA |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|:----|
| **Awareness** | "Marketing chaos is a growth killer" | Stop spending hours on content that doesn't convert | "Teams using structured brand systems grow 2x faster" | Read the guide |
| **Consideration** | "One system, every channel, always on-brand" | Replace ad-hoc content with a repeatable marketing engine | Customer story: "$0 to $1M ARR with 1 marketer" | See how it works |
| **Decision** | "Set up in a day, ship content by week 1" | No agency fees, no onboarding hell, no long-term contract | Free trial + guided setup | Start free trial |

**Key objection handlers**:
- "No bandwidth" → "Takes 20 minutes to set up. Most founders see output in their first session."
- "Just another tool" → "It replaces 3-4 tools and your agency retainer."

### ICP 2: Scaling Marketing Lead (Jordan)

| Funnel Stage | Core Message | Value Prop | Proof Point | CTA |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|:----|
| **Awareness** | "Brand inconsistency kills pipeline" | Every piece of content, on-brand, at scale | "Marketing teams 3x output without adding headcount" | Download the playbook |
| **Consideration** | "The marketing system your team will actually use" | Structured templates + brand guardrails built in | Case study: "Cut content production time by 60%" | Book a demo |
| **Decision** | "Prove ROI by month 2" | Built-in attribution and reporting across all channels | "Average customer sees pipeline impact in 6 weeks" | Start 14-day trial |

**Key objection handlers**:
- "Agency already handles this" → "We work alongside agencies — give them a better brief in half the time."
- "Team consistency" → "Brand guardrails are built into every template — no more off-brand freelancer output."

### ICP 3: Solo Operator (Sam)

| Funnel Stage | Core Message | Value Prop | Proof Point | CTA |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|:----|
| **Awareness** | "Ship marketing like you ship code" | Systematic content production for people who hate marketing busywork | "Indie founders growing to $10K MRR with 30 min/day of marketing" | Join the community |
| **Consideration** | "Your full marketing team in a single workflow" | Brand strategy + content creation + calendar + reporting — all connected | "I went from 0 to 5K followers in 90 days using this system" | Try it free |
| **Decision** | "Pricing that scales with you, not against you" | Free tier for solo operators, affordable as you grow | Transparent pricing page | Get started free |

**Key objection handlers**:

## Universal Messaging Pillars

These themes apply across all ICPs and should appear consistently across channels:

| Pillar | Core Idea | Example Message |
|:-------|:----------|:----------------|
| **Speed** | Marketing shouldn't take forever | "From brief to published in under an hour" |
| **Consistency** | Brand coherence compounds | "Every channel, always on-brand" |
| **Intelligence** | Strategy-first, not just content | "Knows your brand, your audience, your goals" |
| **ROI** | Marketing that moves the needle | "Attribution built in — know what's working" |
| **Simplicity** | Powerful without complexity | "Set up in a day, see results in a week" |
