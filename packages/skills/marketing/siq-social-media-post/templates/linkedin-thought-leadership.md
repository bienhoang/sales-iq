**Character limit**: 3,000 (first ~210 chars show before "...see more")
**Goal**: Build authority, drive engagement, attract ideal customers organically
**Structure**: Hook → Story/Insight → Takeaway → CTA

## Format 1: Insight Post (most common)

```
[HOOK — 1-2 punchy lines. This is all most people see. Make them click "see more."]
[Blank line]
[Blank line]
[Context — 2-3 sentences setting up the insight. Why does this matter?]
[Blank line]
[Core insight or observation — the meat. Can be a list, story, or single idea.]
[Blank line]
[Example or proof — make it concrete. A stat, a customer example, a personal story.]
[Blank line]
[Takeaway — "The lesson:" or "What this means for you:"]
[Blank line]
[1-3 actionable bullet points or a single clear recommendation]
[Blank line]
[CTA — question to drive comments, or soft product mention. One or the other, not both.]
[Blank line]
[3-5 hashtags]
```

### Example skeleton:
```
Most SaaS companies spend 80% of their marketing budget on acquisition.
And almost nothing on retention.

[blank line]

That's backwards.

[blank line]

Here's what the data actually shows:
[blank line]
→ Increasing retention by 5% increases profits by 25-95% (Bain & Company)
→ Acquiring a new customer costs 5-7x more than keeping one
→ Existing customers are 50% more likely to try new products
[blank line]
Yet most marketing teams have 10x more budget for top-of-funnel than lifecycle.
[blank line]
The fix isn't spending less on acquisition.
It's building a retention engine that makes acquisition ROI actually work.
[blank line]
What does your marketing budget split look like? Curious if others are seeing the same.

## LinkedIn-Specific Tips

- **Line breaks are critical** — never write a wall of text. Every 1-3 sentences gets its own line.
- **Lead with conflict or curiosity** — "Most people think X. They're wrong." outperforms "Here are 5 tips about X."
- **No links in the post body** — LinkedIn suppresses posts with external links. Put links in the first comment.
- **Reply to every comment in the first hour** — boosts reach significantly.
- **Post natively** — don't schedule via third-party tools if possible (slight reach penalty).
- **Best posting window**: Tuesday–Thursday, 7:30–9:00am or 12:00–1:00pm (recipient's local time).
