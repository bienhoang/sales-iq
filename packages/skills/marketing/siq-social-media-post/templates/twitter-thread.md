## X / Twitter Best Practices

- **No link in tweet 1** — links kill reach. Drop the link in the last tweet or first reply.
- **Short sentences** — 1-2 sentences per tweet. White space is your friend.
- **Vary tweet length** — mix short punchy tweets with slightly longer ones.
- **Images boost engagement** — add a screenshot, chart, or graphic to tweet 1 or 2.
- **Reply to your own thread** to add the link after posting — boosted reach vs. including in thread.
- **Best time**: Weekdays 9am–12pm. Experiment with early morning (6-8am) for less competition.
- **Repost evergreen threads** — top threads can be reposted every 3-6 months to a growing audience.
