## Preview Text Formulas

Preview text appears after the subject line in the inbox. Treat it as a second subject line.

| Approach | Example |
|:---------|:--------|
| **Expand the subject** | Subject: "3x content output" → Preview: "Here's the exact system we use internally." |
| **Add social proof** | Subject: "New feature" → Preview: "Already used by 200+ teams in beta." |
| **Create urgency** | Subject: "Your trial ends tomorrow" → Preview: "Upgrade now to keep everything you've built." |
| **Ask a question** | Subject: "Quick question" → Preview: "Are you making this common onboarding mistake?" |

**Length**: 40-90 characters. Avoid cutting off mid-sentence.
