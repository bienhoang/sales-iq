# Re-engagement Sequence Template (4 emails, 14 days)

**Trigger**: User inactive for 30+ days (no login, no email opens, no activity)
**Goal**: Win back lapsed users before they churn permanently
**Key principle**: Be human. Don't guilt-trip. Deliver value. Respect their decision at Email 4.

## Segmentation Before Sending

| Segment | Inactivity Period | Approach |
|:--------|:-----------------|:---------|
| Mildly inactive | 30-60 days | Light touch, value-focused |
| Significantly inactive | 60-90 days | "What's new" + offer |
| Deeply inactive | 90+ days | Win-back offer + sunset warning |

## Email 1 — Warm Re-connection (Day 0)

**Subject lines**:
- A: "{{first_name}}, we miss you"
- B: "Still there, {{first_name}}?"
- C: "It's been a while — wanted to check in"

**Preview text**: "No sales pitch. Just a genuine check-in."

```
Hey {{first_name}},

It's been a while since we've seen you in [Product] — just wanted to reach out personally.

No pitch, no pressure. I just wanted to check: is everything okay? Did something not work the way you expected?

If [Product] didn't quite hit the mark for you, I'd genuinely love to know why. Your feedback helps us make it better for everyone.

And if life just got busy (it happens to all of us), your account is exactly where you left it whenever you're ready.

Reply here if you want to talk — I read every message.

[Title], [Product]

## Email 2 — What's New (Day 3)

**Subject lines**:
- A: "A lot has changed since you left, {{first_name}}"
- B: "Here's what's new in [Product]"
- C: "{{first_name}}, you might want to see this"

**Preview text**: "3 things we shipped that you haven't seen yet."

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Since you last logged in, we've shipped a few things I think you'll find useful:

**[New feature 1]** — [1-sentence benefit]
**[New feature 2]** — [1-sentence benefit]
**[Improvement]** — [1-sentence benefit]

The [feature most relevant to their past usage] is especially worth checking out — it directly addresses [pain point].

[CTA: "See what's new →"]

[Name]

P.S. If you'd like a quick walkthrough of what's changed, I'm happy to jump on a 15-min call: [calendar link]

## Email 3 — Win-Back Offer (Day 7)

**Subject lines**:
- A: "A little something to welcome you back, {{first_name}}"
- B: "{{first_name}}, here's an offer — no strings attached"
- C: "Come back for free — [X] days on us"

**Preview text**: "Our way of saying we'd love to have you back."

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I want to make it easy to give [Product] another shot.

For the next [X] days, I'm offering you [specific incentive — e.g., "an extended trial", "30% off your first month", "a free onboarding session"].

No catch. No long-term commitment. Just a chance to see how things have improved since you last logged in.

[CTA: "Claim your offer →"]

Offer expires [date].

[Name]

P.S. If there's a specific reason you stopped using [Product], reply here. If it's something we can fix for you personally, I want to try.
```

## Email 4 — Last Contact (Day 14)

**Subject lines**:
- A: "Is this goodbye, {{first_name}}?"
- B: "Last email — I promise"
- C: "Closing the loop, {{first_name}}"

**Preview text**: "One last thing, then we'll leave you alone."

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times now without hearing back — so I'll make this my last message for a while. I don't want to be another source of inbox noise.

If you've moved on from [Product], I completely understand. No hard feelings.

One small ask: could you tell me why? It takes 30 seconds and directly shapes what we build. [1-click feedback survey link]

If you ever want to come back, your account will be here waiting. And if you'd like to be removed from our list entirely, just click below — no questions asked.

[CTA: "Share quick feedback →"]  |  [Unsubscribe link]

Wishing you the best,
