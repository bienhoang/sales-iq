## Discord Formatting Reference

| Element | Syntax | When to Use |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| **Bold** | `**text**` | Key terms, feature names |
| *Italic* | `*text*` | Emphasis, secondary info |
| `Code` | `` `text` `` | Technical terms, commands |
| > Quote | `> text` | Callouts, links, highlights |
| Channel mention | `<#channel-id>` | Direct to a specific channel |
| User mention | `<@user-id>` | Ping specific person (use sparingly) |
| Role mention | `<@&role-id>` | Ping a role group (use sparingly) |
| Embed color hint | In bot embeds | Green=success, Blue=info, Yellow=warning, Red=alert |

**Line length**: Keep lines short. Discord wraps on mobile — long lines become walls of text.
**Emojis**: 1-3 per announcement max. Use to signal tone, not decorate.
**Reactions**: Always add a reaction prompt — it drives engagement and signals tone.
