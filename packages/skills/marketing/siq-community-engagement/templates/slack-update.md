## Slack Formatting Reference

| Element | Syntax | Notes |
|:--------|:-------|:------|
| *Bold* | `*text*` | Key terms, feature names |
| _Italic_ | `_text_` | Secondary emphasis |
| ~Strikethrough~ | `~text~` | Corrections, humor |
| `Code` | `` `text` `` | Technical content |
| Code block | ` ```text``` ` | Multi-line code or structured data |
| > Blockquote | `>text` | Callouts or quotes |
| Channel | `#channel-name` | Link to channel |
| Person | `@name` | Mention (use sparingly in announcements) |

**Best practices**:
- Keep the first line short and scannable — it shows in notifications
- Use threads for discussion to keep the main channel clean
- Emoji reactions as voting mechanism — set the tone with your own reaction
- Don't @here or @channel unless truly urgent — train your community to trust those pings
- Schedule announcements for business hours in your community's primary timezone
