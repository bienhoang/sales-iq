# Community Escalation Playbook

## When to Escalate

Not every issue needs the same response. Use this guide to calibrate.

| Severity | Examples | Response Time | Who Handles |
|:---------|:---------|:-------------|:------------|
| **Low** | Off-topic post, minor formatting issue | 24 hrs | Any moderator |
| **Medium** | Self-promotion without disclosure, repeated low-effort posts | 4 hrs | Moderator |
| **High** | Harassment, heated conflict, spam wave | 1 hr | Community Lead |
| **Critical** | Hate speech, doxxing, illegal content, scam | Immediately | Community Lead + escalate to leadership |

## Response Templates

### Low: Off-Topic Post

**In-thread (friendly redirect)**:
```
Hey [Name] — great question! This might get more traction in #[relevant-channel].
Mind if I move it there? [Or: I'll leave a pointer here for others.]
```

**DM (if pattern)**:
```
Hey [Name], just a heads up — [post topic] fits better in #[channel].
No worries at all, just wanted to let you know for next time!
```

---

### Medium: Unsolicited Self-Promotion

**In-thread (public, friendly)**:
```
Hey [Name], we love that you're sharing resources! Quick note:
our guidelines ask members to disclose when they have a stake in something they're sharing.
Just add a note like "I built this" or "I work there" and we're good 👍
```

**DM (follow-up)**:
```
Hi [Name], following up on my note in #[channel].
No harm done — we just want to keep the community feeling trustworthy for everyone.
Here are our guidelines if helpful: [link]
Let me know if you have questions!
[Moderator name]
```

---

### Medium: Heated Discussion

**In-thread (de-escalate)**:
```
Let's keep this one productive, everyone 🙏
[Name] and [Name] — I can see you both have strong views here.
Let's focus on the ideas, not each other.
If you want to continue this, feel free to take it to DMs or I can set up a focused thread.
```

**DM to both parties**:
```
Hi [Name], I stepped in on the thread in #[channel].
I know these topics can get heated — I've been there too.
Just wanted to check in and make sure everything's okay on your end.
Happy to chat if you want to talk through anything.
[Moderator name]
```

### High: Harassment

**Immediate in-thread action**:
```
[Remove the message]
[Post in thread]: A message has been removed for violating our community guidelines.
If you were affected, please DM me directly.
```

**DM to target**:
```
Hi [Name], I saw what happened in #[channel] and I've removed the message.
I'm really sorry you experienced that here.
Are you okay? Is there anything you need from me right now?
[Moderator name]
```

**DM to offender**:
```
Hi [Name], your message in #[channel] was removed because it violated our guidelines around [harassment/hate speech/etc.].
This is a serious violation.
[First offense]: This is a formal warning. Further violations will result in removal from the community.
[Repeat offense]: Your account has been [muted for X days / removed from the community].
If you believe this was an error, reply here.
[Community Lead name]
```

### Critical: Illegal Content / Scam / Hate Speech

**Immediate actions (in this order)**:
1. Screenshot / document the content before removing
2. Remove the content immediately
3. Ban or suspend the account
4. Notify Community Lead within 15 minutes
5. Document in the incident log (date, content summary, action taken)
6. If content is potentially illegal (CSAM, credible threats): escalate to leadership + legal immediately

**Do NOT**:
- Engage in extended conversation with the offender
- Share the content with others (even as warning)
- Delay action to get more information — act first, document second

---

## Incident Log Template

Keep a private log of all medium+ incidents:

| Date | Platform | Channel | Incident Summary | Action Taken | Moderator | Status |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|:----------------|:-------------|:----------|:-------|
| | | | | | | Open/Closed |

## Support Escalation (Product Issues)

When a member has a product problem that community can't solve:

**Response in community**:
```
Hey [Name], this sounds like something our support team can help with directly.
→ [Support email / help center link]
They're usually pretty quick — I'd expect a response within [X] hours.
Let us know here if you're still stuck after reaching out!
```

**Internal handoff** (if you have a support Slack):
```
@support-team — [Name] in [Discord/Slack community] is experiencing [brief description].
I've pointed them to the help desk but flagging here in case it needs priority attention.
[Link to their community message]
```
