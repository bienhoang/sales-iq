## The Spirit of This Community

This is a space for [product category] practitioners to learn, share, and grow together. We're here to help each other — not to sell to each other.

**Three things we care about most**:
1. **Be helpful** — Share real experiences, honest feedback, and genuine advice
2. **Be respectful** — Disagree with ideas, not with people
3. **Be here in good faith** — No spam, no hidden agendas, no self-promotion without disclosure

---

## What's Encouraged

- Sharing wins, losses, and learnings — all three equally
- Asking questions (no such thing as a dumb question here)
- Giving detailed, specific feedback when asked
- Tagging relevant members into conversations they'd benefit from
- Celebrating other members' achievements
- Sharing resources, articles, templates that helped you

---

## What's Not Allowed

### Strict rules (instant removal + ban)
- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination of any kind
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent
- Illegal content or activities
- Scams or fraudulent solicitations

### Soft rules (warning → removal)
- **Self-promotion without disclosure** — If you're sharing something you built or benefit from, say so. We're fine with it if you're transparent.
- **Unsolicited DMs** — Don't cold pitch community members via DM. If someone asks for help finding a solution, you can mention your product.
- **Low-effort posts** — "Anyone else using X?" with no context helps no one. Add what you know, what you've tried, or what you're looking for.
- **Cross-posting** — Don't post the same message in multiple channels
- **Derailing threads** — Keep threads on topic; start a new thread for new topics

## Moderation Process

We aim to be fair and consistent. Here's how we handle issues:

1. **First violation** (minor): Private DM explaining the issue — educational, not punitive
2. **Second violation** (or first serious one): Public note in thread + DM
3. **Repeated or serious violations**: Temporary mute or removal from community
4. **Egregious violations**: Immediate permanent ban (no warning required)

**Appeals**: DM a moderator or email [support email]. We take appeals seriously.
