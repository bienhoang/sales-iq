# Strategy Design

## Core Principles

Follow these fundamental principles:
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Don't add initiatives until necessary
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Prefer simple strategies over complex ones
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) - Reuse existing assets, messaging, and processes

## Design Activities

### Business Trade-off Analysis
- Evaluate multiple approaches for each objective
- Compare pros and cons with projected ROI, CAC, and LTV impact
- Consider short-term wins vs long-term brand building
- Balance budget efficiency with market coverage
- Assess resource requirements vs expected outcomes
- Recommend optimal strategy based on current market conditions

### Brand Consistency & Compliance
- Ensure all planned activities align with brand voice and positioning
- Verify messaging consistency across proposed channels
- Check regulatory and compliance requirements (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, industry-specific)
- Validate that strategy reinforces (not dilutes) brand positioning
- Consider legal review needs for claims, comparisons, testimonials

### Budget Efficiency & Channel Scalability
- Identify budget allocation trade-offs across channels
- Consider channel-specific CAC and diminishing returns
- Plan for scaling successful tactics (budget, team, automation)
- Assess resource usage (team bandwidth, tool costs, creative capacity)
- Design for sustainable growth, not one-time spikes
- Plan for multi-channel attribution and measurement
- Consider automation opportunities for repetitive tasks

### Market Risks & Competitive Response
- Think through competitive counter-moves
- Plan for market shifts and seasonal factors
- Consider channel saturation and audience fatigue
- Design contingency plans for underperforming channels
- Plan for economic/budget downturn scenarios
- Consider dependency risks (platform changes, algorithm updates)

### Campaign & Funnel Architecture
- Design end-to-end campaign architectures
- Map customer journey touchpoints
- Plan content and asset requirements per stage
- Design lead qualification and handoff flows
- Consider multi-channel orchestration
- Plan nurture sequences and re-engagement loops
