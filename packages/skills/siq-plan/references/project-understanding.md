# Project Understanding Phase

**When to skip:** If provided with scout reports, skip this phase.

## Core Activities

### Project Scouting
- Use `siq-scout` skill to discover relevant files and existing strategy materials
- Each scout locates documents needed for specific aspects of the plan
- Wait for all scouts to report before analysis
- Efficient for finding existing brand docs, campaign history, and templates

### Essential Document Review
ALWAYS read these workspace files first (if they exist):

1. **`workspace/strategy/`** (IMPORTANT)
   - Brand strategy and positioning docs
   - ICP definitions and buyer personas
   - Messaging pillars and value propositions
   - Competitive positioning frameworks

2. **`workspace/intel/`**
   - Competitor analysis and battlecards
   - Market research findings
   - Industry benchmarks

3. **`workspace/reports/`**
   - Pipeline reports and metrics
   - Campaign performance data
   - Historical conversion rates

4. **`.sales-iq.json`** (project config)
   - Brand name and context
   - Active skill configurations

### Brand & Channel Analysis
- Review existing brand strategy and voice guidelines
- Analyze current channel performance and mix
- Identify active campaigns and their status
- Understand budget allocation and constraints

### Pattern Recognition
- Study existing strategy patterns in workspace
- Identify conventions and recurring themes
- Note consistency in messaging and positioning
- Understand customer journey and funnel stages

### Campaign Integration Planning
- Identify how new initiatives integrate with existing campaigns
- Map dependencies between channels and content
- Understand lead flow and handoff points
- Consider impact on existing pipeline

## Best Practices

- Start with strategy docs before diving into details
- Use scouts for targeted document discovery
- Document patterns found for consistency
- Note any gaps or inconsistencies in existing strategy
- Consider impact on existing campaigns and pipeline
