# Example: Go-to-Market Channel Strategy with Sequential Thinking

**Problem**: Choose go-to-market channel strategy for B2B SaaS targeting mid-market ops teams.

## Sequential Thinking Approach

```
Thought 1/4: Current channel performance audit

Existing acquisition data (last 6 months, n=84 customers):
- Inbound content/SEO: 31 customers, avg CAC $820, avg close 47 days
- Outbound cold email: 22 customers, avg CAC $2,100, avg close 62 days
- Referrals/word-of-mouth: 18 customers, avg CAC $290, avg close 31 days
- Paid ads (LinkedIn): 9 customers, avg CAC $3,400, avg close 78 days
- Events/partnerships: 4 customers, avg CAC $1,800, avg close 55 days

Referrals strongest unit economics but not scalable as primary channel.
Content/SEO showing best scalable CAC. Paid ads burning budget.
Next: Define requirements for channel selection

Thought 2/5: Requirements and channel options (adjusted)

Company context:
- 3 AEs, 1 content marketer, $180k/year channel budget
- Target: 200 new customers in 12 months (from current 84)
- ICP: Ops directors at 50–500 person B2B companies
- Product: Self-serve onboarding available, avg deal size $4,800 ARR

Channel options to evaluate:
- Content marketing + SEO (inbound, long compound curve)
- Outbound sales + ABM (direct, fast feedback, resource-heavy)
- Product-led growth / PLG (self-serve expansion, requires product investment)
- Paid social/SEM (fast but high CAC, budget-sensitive)
- Partnerships and integrations (leverage others' distribution)

Need to evaluate across: CAC, time-to-revenue, team capacity, 12-month scalability.
Next: Explore leading candidates in parallel

Thought 3/5 [BRANCH A]: Content + SEO led growth

Strategy: Build authoritative content for ops team pain points.
Target: 40 high-intent keywords, 2 posts/week, 6-month SEO ramp.

Projected metrics (month 12):
- Organic sessions: ~15,000/mo
- Trial signups: ~300/mo (2% conversion)
- Paid customers: ~45/mo (15% trial-to-paid)
- CAC: ~$680 (below current inbound avg)

Strengths: Compounding returns, low marginal CAC at scale, brand authority.
Weaknesses: 4–6 month lag before material results. Miss 12-month target
unless supplemented. Requires consistent content investment.

Thought 3/5 [BRANCH B]: Outbound sales + ABM approach

Strategy: 3 AEs running targeted outbound to named account lists.
Target: 500 accounts/month touched, 3% meeting rate, 20% close rate.

Projected metrics (month 12):
- Meetings booked: ~15/mo per AE (45 total)
- Pipeline: ~$540k ARR/month at full ramp
- Customers added: ~120 over 12 months
- CAC: ~$2,200 blended (heavier at start, improves with playbook)

Strengths: Predictable pipeline, fast feedback loop, ICP targeting precision.
Weaknesses: CAC 3x higher than content. AE capacity hits ceiling fast.
Dependent on good prospecting data and strong sequence copy.

Thought 4/6: Comparing branches (adjusted)

Metric comparison:

                    Branch A (Content)    Branch B (Outbound)
CAC                 $680                  $2,200
Time to revenue     4-6 month lag         30-45 days
12-mo customers     ~90 (ramp limited)    ~120 (AE limited)
Team capacity fit   1 content hire        3 AEs at capacity
Budget fit          $60k/year             $90k+ (tools + time)
Scalability         High (compound)       Medium (headcount-tied)

Neither branch alone hits 200 customers. Gap: ~80 customers.
Product has self-serve onboarding — PLG motion available but underutilized.
SMB segment (<50 seats) converting at 18% trial-to-paid with zero sales touch.
Next: Synthesize hybrid model

Thought 5/6: Converge — hybrid approach

Insight: Current channels serve different segments poorly because they're not separated.

Proposed motion by segment:

SMB (<30 seats, ACV <$2,400):
- PLG: Self-serve trial → automated nurture → product upgrade triggers
- No sales touch, reduce friction, optimize activation rate
- Channel: Content/SEO drives top of funnel

Mid-market (30–200 seats, ACV $2,400–$15,000):
- Outbound + ABM: AEs focus exclusively here
- Content assists (case studies, ROI calculators as sales tools)
- Channel: Outbound + inbound blend

Enterprise (200+ seats):
- Defer to month 9 — need CS infrastructure first
- Build case studies from mid-market wins

This unlocks both channels without splitting AE time across all deal sizes.
Next: Define KPIs and resource allocation

Thought 6/7: Channel KPIs and resource allocation

Budget allocation ($180k/year):
- Content/SEO: $55k (1 FTE content + tools)
- Outbound tools + data: $35k (Apollo, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Nav)
- Paid retargeting (bottom funnel only): $25k
- Events (2 targeted ICP events): $20k
- Reserve/testing: $45k

KPIs by channel:
- PLG/Content: Trial signups, activation rate (%), time-to-first-value
- Outbound/ABM: Meeting rate, pipeline coverage (3x target), AE quota attainment
- Overall: Blended CAC, NRR (expansion signal), logo growth

Review gates: 60-day check on outbound meeting rate; 90-day check on SEO traction.
If outbound meeting rate <2%, pause and revise targeting/sequences before scaling.

Thought 7/7 [FINAL]: Phased rollout with milestone gates

Phase 1 (Month 1–2): Foundation
- Launch outbound sequences for mid-market ACV targets
- Separate PLG/SMB funnel with automated onboarding emails
- Publish 8 cornerstone content pieces (long-tail, high intent)

Phase 2 (Month 3–5): Ramp
- Gate: Outbound meeting rate must hit 2.5% before adding 4th AE
- PLG activation rate target: 25% (trial → active in 7 days)
- SEO: Track keyword ranking movement, not yet revenue

Phase 3 (Month 6–12): Scale
- Gate: Content driving >100 trials/month before increasing content budget
- Introduce partner channel (integration partners with overlapping ICP)
- Begin building enterprise motion if 10+ mid-market logos secured

Projected outcome (month 12):
- PLG/SMB: ~70 new customers
- Outbound mid-market: ~110 new customers
- Total: ~180 customers (90% of 200 target; conservative)

Confidence: Medium-High
Assumptions: Self-serve activation improves with onboarding work; AEs ramp in 60 days
Trade-offs: Slower brand build vs faster short-term pipeline from pure outbound
```

## Key Insights

1. **Branch exploration surfaced gap**: Neither channel alone hit target — forced hybrid thinking
2. **Segment separation crucial**: Mixing SMB and mid-market in one motion dilutes both
3. **PLG as unlocked lever**: Existing self-serve capability underutilized before analysis
4. **Milestone gates prevent overcommit**: Resource expansion tied to performance signals

## Impact of Branch Analysis

Without Branch A/B exploration, would have defaulted to "more outbound" (obvious lever),
hit AE capacity ceiling at month 6, and missed the PLG opportunity entirely. Branch comparison
revealed the hybrid model as higher-ceiling strategy within existing budget.
